The sound policies and timely interventions of RBI have ensured that we were well prepared for the monetary tightening that happened in the developed world after the inflationary pressures manifested themselves across the globe. The Bank has responded to the evolving liquidity scenario and calibrated its response over the past year.\nscale manufacturing through schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI).\nOverall, the past fiscal year has shown strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the country. However, slowdown in household savings has put a strain on liquidity across the economy. Your Bank has been well placed to obtain the benefits of this growth and has actively funded the small and medium enterprises that form the backbone of the economy as well retail consumers, managing well within the constraints of liquidity and elevated costs of incremental funding.\nIt gives me immense pleasure to present to you the Integrated Annual Report of your Bank for the Financial Year 2023-24.\nI would like to congratulate my fellow Board members, the entire team of the Bank and erstwhile HDFC Limited for having accomplished one of the most complex mergers in the financial services industry by completing the process in a very seamless, efficient and effective manner. I am grateful for the support of Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Competition Commission of India (CCI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), the stock exchanges and other regulatory authorities for providing their approvals and guidance during the entire process.\nThe merger has further strengthened our position as a leading financial conglomerate of India and our Bank is now the custodian of the venerated HDFC brand that was created and nurtured by the late Mr. H T Parekh, Mr. Deepak Parekh and capable and eminent members of his team.\nThe financial year gone by has seen the GDP in India grow at 8.2 per cent while global GDP growth was 3.2 per cent in 2023. We continue to remain the world’s fastest growing major economy, with GDP growth projected at 7.2 per cent in the current financial year. This has come about despite a slowdown in global growth. The GDP growth has been supported by a boost in capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure development, including roads, highways, railways and housing. Between FY22 and FY24, overall capex growth in the economy stood at 11.0 per cent on an average with government doing the heavy lifting. Private sector investment also showed some signs of resurgence in sectors such as cement, steel, and oil and gas. Growth has also received a fillip through a rise in manufacturing and construction activity. This has been due to a combination of lower input costs, Government support to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector through Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and large\nReaping Synergies of the Merger\nAs we complete one year of the merger, I am happy to note that the process of integration has been completed seamlessly and efficiently across all dimensions of the business and customer services and we have put in place robust risk management and compliance functions from a supervisory perspective for the Bank and the subsidiaries, which now cover a substantially large footprint in the financial services domain. The synergies of the merger are being manifested through the combined strengths of the two merged entities, the home loan expertise of erstwhile HDFC Limited and the extensive distribution franchise of HDFC Bank. Today, most of our branches are selling home loans, including those in semi urban and rural locations. As the nation's growth story unfolds, we stand prepared to reap the benefits through this historic combination.\n18",

The Bank ensured prudent risk management and asset quality across portfolios. Its profit after tax grew by 37.9 per cent to H60,812.3 crore on a standalone post-merger basis. A comprehensive view of our performance is captured in the report placed before you.\nDuring the year Mr. Sashidhar Jagdishan was reappointed as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank with effect from October 27, 2023. Mr. Kaizad M Bharucha, was elevated as Deputy Managing Director of the Bank w.e.f. April 19, 2023. Mr. Bhavesh Zaveri and Mr. V.

Our commitment to this principle is underscored in our CSR programme. Our core focus areas are Rural Development, Education, Skilling and Livelihood, Healthcare and Financial Literacy and Inclusion. Our Bank has cumulatively impacted over 10 crore lives through our social initiatives.\nGovernance\nCustomer Experience and Building Technology for the Future\nAs a fully Board governed entity with no promoter, the weight of responsibility is on us to ensure best standards of governance to look after the interests of shareholders, depositors, employees and other stakeholders. As a responsible financial institution, we strive to create sustained value for all our stakeholders without compromising on our core values of Customer Focus, Operational Excellence, Product Leadership, People and Sustainability in our day-to-day operations.

The Board of your Bank increased oversight on ESG disclosures and climate-related risks as well as keeping abreast with evolving regulatory frameworks.\nIn Conclusion\nThroughout the year, the Board Committee meetings were convened regularly, playing a pivotal role in assessing critical areas of the Bank's governance. These Committees facilitate the governance and supervisory responsibilities of the Board members as they provide oversight and feedback on critical areas and the performance of the management of the Bank. Cognisant of our status as a large financial conglomerate we have also put in place group level oversight of compliance and risk management of the diverse subsidiaries, while at the same time\nI extend my sincere thanks to all our stakeholders for their continued support, and most of all, to the large HDFC Bank family of over two hundred thousand people.

Continuity, as India remained the fastest growing major economy in the world; change, as there was a transformational merger between parent, HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank. I feel fortunate to be a part of the Indian economy right now, which is teeming with opportunities.

The Indian economy bucked this trend and recorded a growth of 8.2 per cent in Financial Year 2023-24 from a growth rate of 7.0 per cent in the previous financial year - the highest among major economies.\nMoreover, the benefit from Government reforms and support measures over the last few years, like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes is likely to boost manufacturing activity and attract FDI flows. Besides, a continued diversification of supply chains to newer emerging markets is likely to benefit investment flows into India.\nYour Bank has exhibited robust and consistent double-digit, year-on- year growth across its Home Loan business for the first nine months, post the merger. On a sequential basis too, it has gained a leading position recording a growth of 4 per cent.\nIndia is clearly in a good place for economic growth and we feel well placed to capitalise on the positive environment.\nThe country’s GDP growth averaged 8.3 per cent annually over the last three fiscal years, the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. This was supported by a capital expenditure boost (particularly in infrastructure development, including roads, railways, and housing), moderating inflation, strong manufacturing performance and healthy consumer demand, especially in urban areas.\nPre-merger approximately 30 to 35 per cent of incremental home loan disbursals were to customers with an HDFC Bank savings account. This has now touched approximately 85 per cent of incremental disbursals in a space of just nine months. This has been possible due to the extensive distribution network of the Bank, seamless integration of bundled journeys and the execution capability of our teams on the ground, which I am really proud of. Our ability to build a strong liability franchise leveraging home loan customers is well on its way to fruition.\nThe Merger\nWe’ve recently completed one year of the merger which formally came into effect on July 1, 2023. In many ways it is now a new organisation with a different balance sheet composition. For example, it has a higher proportion of borrowing at 21 per cent versus 8 per cent pre-merger and a lower CASA ratio. Key metrics of the new organisation will be different than that of pre-merger levels. For us, this is HDFC Bank 2.0 that has to be seen differently, and comparing with the past in terms of metrics would not be the right way.\nOverall credit growth has been in double digits since April 2022. Higher demand for consumer durables and greater retail spends have boosted retail credit growth. Retail loans have increased at a CAGR of 19 per cent over the last five years, outpacing the growth in nominal GDP. During this period, the RBI has issued advisory to banks on strengthening the acquisition, monitoring and collection process as the unsecured loan growth has outpaced the overall loan growth.\nOur home loan customers also enjoy the benefit of a strong suite of financial products and solutions that the Bank can offer, like credit cards, consumer durable loans, wealth products, and insurance. This approach helps strengthen customer relationship and enables HDFC Bank emerge as the primary banker for these customers. While we have seen strong traction on savings accounts being opened along with home loans, we will now focus our energies on leveraging the cross-sell opportunity of both, the\nThe merger has presented the Bank with a massive opportunity which we’re working to seize. India is today in the midst of unprecedented urbanisation, fuelled by rising incomes and aspirations cutting across metros and beyond. The real estate sector is expected to reach a market size of US$1 trillion by 2030, a significant increase from US$ 200 billion in 2021, contributing 13 per cent to the country’s GDP by 2025.\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) anticipates India’s GDP growth to be at 7.2 per cent in Financial Year 2024- 25. Economic activity is likely to be supported by further pick-up in private capital expenditure and continued Government capital spending.\n2 1",

While we remain committed to an open architecture model, we do expect to distribute more of the subsidiaries investment and insurance products, leading to an increase in fee income.\nWe continue to spearhead several digital initiatives to enhance customer convenience and expedite the home loan process. Leveraging technology, these initiatives aim to streamline the process and ensure faster turnaround times.\nAll in all, the task of bringing together the leadership teams, technology infrastructures, and cultures of the two entities has been successful, allowing us to pursue our organisation goals as one team.\nOur Performance\nYour Bank grew in the last financial year while continuing to demonstrate its traditional balance sheet resilience.\nThe figures for the period ended March 31, 2024 include the operations of erstwhile HDFC Limited, which amalgamated with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence the comparisons with the previous periods have to be looked at in light of the same.\nOn a standalone basis the Profit After Tax (PAT) for the year ended March 31, 2024 was H60,812.3 crore, up by 37.9 per cent over the year ended March 31, 2023. Net Interest Income (NII) for the year ended March 31, 2024 was H1,08, 532 crore up 25.0 per cent over the year ended March 31, 2023. The figure crossed the Rupee one trillion\nmark for the first time in the Bank’s history. Core Net Interest Margin stood at 3.53 per cent and Gross NPAs at 1.24 per cent.\nThere has been a lot of discussion around our Net Interest Margin (NIM) and credit to deposit ratio post our merger as well as the path we would pursue, given the scale of deposit mobilisation required for our growth needs. Post the merger, we are looking at a very different liability profile. We are clear in our intent of pursuing profitable growth. The Bank will continue to focus on granular deposit mobilisation leveraging our inherent distribution strengths and the execution focus that we are known for. It is our endeavour to bring down the credit to deposit ratio to pre-merger levels and our focus would be to maintain adequate liquidity buffers, repayment of eHDFC borrowings as and when they mature, including weighing any prepayment opportunities that may arise, and pursuing profitable sources of lending. During this time of adjustment, the Bank would grow its advances a little slower than the deposit growth. We will avoid pursuing growth which does not meet our risk adjusted profitability thresholds, in line with the Bank’s philosophy.\nTechnology Update\nI have been consistently sharing updates with you on my key focus areas - improving technology resilience, building for the future, and the three Cs: Culture, Conscience, and Customer. Let me now elaborate on these.\nTechnology has become the cornerstone of modern banking, driving innovation, security, efficiency,\nand new customer experiences. The Bank embraces technology's evolution into a growth catalyst through the ‘Shift Right’ strategy. Our vision is to shift from a product-centric approach to a customer-centric one through five transformation pillars built on modern technology constructs.\nWith Journeys being a key enabler, the Bank now has over 30 acquisition journeys and 15 servicing journeys, including exciting launches such as FD booking, gold loan top-ups, and innovative home loan cross-sell offerings. Today, more than three- quarters of our acquisitions are digitally driven, with straight-through processing leading to paperless experiences. Our state-of-the-art commercial loan origination engine facilitates in-principle approvals for customers within 30 minutes.\nWe are taking significant steps to transform our digital Channels into holistic platforms. Our indigenous mobile and net banking platforms are set to introduce a host of new experiences. In the past year, many of our platforms have gained significant traction. For instance, SmartWealth already has over 1,00,000 customers and Chat Banking through WhatsApp is the preferred channel with over 90 lakh monthly interactions.

We have also scaled up key systems to accommodate the further expansion of our branches and are increasing our hardware and infrastructure capacity by upgrading to a next-gen core platform. Additionally, we have deployed new platforms in retail assets and microfinance for increased resilience. We introduced a digital-only platform for credit cards, enabling us to launch PIXEL cards. In summary, we are reinforcing our core platforms across retail business landscape.\nWith Data as the focal point of our strategy, we have made substantial progress in our Data Lake initiative for improved data governance and quality. This will pave the way for a holistic reengineering of our enterprise customer database, furthering the ‘Hollow the Core’ strategy. The Bank has taken multiple strides and is actively leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in areas such as fraud monitoring, risk management, credit decisioning and marketing analytics. This year saw the explosion of GenAI as a key, once-in-a-generation technology capability; and your Bank has been actively exploring use cases that could eventually prove instrumental in revolutionising areas like image recognition, language translation and statement analysis. We are also mindful of adopting these technologies within regulatory and security guardrails in a calibrated manner.\nHaving a stronger commitment than ever to Security, we have further bolstered our posture through frameworks such as Zero Trust Architecture for strengthened security and multi-layered defence mechanisms. Our Cyber Security Operations Center is now powered by an advanced AI/ML based platform, which can detect attack patterns with high accuracy. We are also advancing to adopt security engineering practices natively in our software engineering and development lifecycles.\nI am proud to share that technology played a crucial role in ensuring a seamless merger despite substantial complexities. Integrating over 100 applications through data migration and a multitude of backend system changes, the activity was fully managed and executed by in-house teams imbibing us with further confidence in our capabilities.\nLooking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities that come our way as we continue our journey towards becoming a future-ready digital bank. Our commitment to delivering exceptional experiences and inclusive banking services will be driven by the adoption of new-age technologies focusing on scalability, resilience and security while building the bank for the future.\nCyber Security\nAt HDFC Bank, cybersecurity and data privacy best practices are important priorities. The Bank remains committed to maintaining a secure cybersecurity posture to protect its technology, confidential information, data integrity, and business continuity. Our strong information security\nprogramme, security policies and processes are aligned with various information security management frameworks in the industry and provide necessary assurance on protecting the Bank’s critical information. It is an ongoing battle which requires continuous investment as the threat landscape is constantly evolving.\nOur deepest anguish is the threat landscape our customers face leading to compromise of their credentials and a financial loss. The Bank has invested in technology using AI and ML to arrest attempts at customers falling prey to scams and fraudsters. We urge customers to continue to be vigilant and follow safe banking practices, not allowing socially engineered fraud to succeed. The Bank has regularly been running Secure Banking campaigns through social media, SMS, Emails, ATMs, Bank website and various other channels. Your Bank’s Vigil Aunty campaign covering the various modus-operandi of fraudsters is one such example of awareness building. Further, we continue to collaborate with law enforcement agencies, regulatory authorities and peer banks to educate customers on safe banking practices.\nCustomer Centricity\nMy biggest priorities remain deep customer engagement and strengthening a Service First culture.\nOur implementation of Net Promoter System (NPS), branded as ‘Infinite Smiles’ programme has been one of the largest implementations in the world. This programme provides us with immediate and continuous customer feedback for us to listen, learn and act on the feedback,\n2 3",

We have a robust governance framework in place to continuously listen to this feedback and take appropriate action. I am glad to report that compared to the last financial year we have an eight percentage points improvement in our NPS score.\nTo further improve the Service First culture, we have instituted two key initiatives this year along with increasing the weightage of service in the performance measurement framework across all levels in the organisation. The first one is a structured intervention centre framework to continuously monitor our customer experience delivery across the customer life cycle. The response from our colleagues has been tremendous for this framework. We are seeing good improvements in getting the customer experience delivery right the first time as well as achieving faster turnaround times. The digitalisation of many of our service and acquisition journeys is also being increasingly adopted, both by employees and customers, resulting in further improvements. The second one is highly monitored coaching of our front end colleagues for deeper customer engagement. Whilst the initiatives have yielded results, we have a long way to go to reach a new orbit in Service First culture.\nworkforce should comprise women by 2025. Women representation in our workforce currently exceeds 55,000 employees and has crossed 26 per cent.\nThe Bank, like the rest of the BFSI sector, has experienced a volatile talent landscape in recent times. Attrition was a matter of concern for the Bank as it was for the industry in Financial Year 2022-23. However, in Financial year 2023-24, most of the industry has seen a slight moderation in the attrition rate and that is reflected in our numbers too. Nevertheless, in Financial Year 2023-24 the Bank has taken several efforts to arrest attrition, including setting up a task force at the highest level to identify the controllable causes and taking corrective action. Managers are the primary custodians of talent, and much effort has been made to raise awareness and accountability towards retention and engagement of their teams. Your Bank has invested in improving employee experience across various touch points along the employee lifecycle. This includes an enhanced onboarding experience, curated customised professional learning through Mpower (our learning experience platform) and an active listening framework, to stay connected with the pulse on the ground. As a result, in Financial Year 2023-24, we saw a drop in new joiner attrition by 10 per cent over last year and the overall attrition drop by over 7 per cent.\nof an AI based learning experience platform for employees which enjoyed an adoption rate of 86 per cent in the first 30 days, getting off to a promising start.\nOver the last few years, we have institutionalised Nurture, Care and Collaborate as a Managerial Behavioural Architecture. This has impacted the overall culture and employee experience as evidenced in the progressive positive shift in the employee sentiment scores over the last four years (75 per cent in Financial Year 2019-20 to 86 per cent in Financial Year 2023-24). Having said that, there is still much to be done and we are earnestly working on it to make this institution an even better place to work for.\nThe year gone by has been especially memorable for the Bank because we welcomed our colleagues from erstwhile HDFC Limited into the Bank’s fold. The amalgamation was a smooth one given that the culture and values of the organisations were aligned. We have always held that the talent, commitment and passion of our people is the bedrock of our success and investing in this talent pool can only add to a service first culture and good customer experience.\nGetting The Organisation Future Ready\nPeople\nI am proud to share with you the progress that we have made in our quest to be a more inclusive organisation. The year marked several milestones in this journey, an important one being our meeting and exceeding the threshold we had set for ourselves - that 25 per cent of our\nYour Bank continues to invest in upskilling its talent base of over 2,00,000 employees.

The Bank added over 900 branches in the year under review and will continue to add more in the current financial year. More than half our branches are in the semi urban and rural areas where a physical presence is often a necessity although the majority of the transactions are digital in nature. These phygital branches are our investments. They will undoubtedly help garner deposits in the future, but it is the older branches that will act as current engines of deposit mobilisation. Our experience clearly reveals that there is an exponential growth in deposit base as the branches age. Our past experience indicates that deposit mobilisation has a strong correlation to the vintage of the branch. The investment in new branches is to ensure that we do not lose out on opportunities for the future while the existing branches continue to drive deposit growth.\non strategies that shape the Bank’s future pathways. Your Bank not only remains steadfast in its commitment to transparency in reporting on both, financial and non-financial parameters, but is now moving beyond this. While globally ESG frameworks are still evolving, our ESG disclosures are increasingly going through a similar rigour as financial parameters - especially with the mandating of assurance on certain ESG attributes.\nThe year under review marked the issuance of our first sustainable bond in the international markets which was well received. On the lending side, we continue to integrate environmental and social due diligence as an integral part of our overall credit assessments.\nESG considerations also have dependencies on the overall global macro and geopolitical environment, pace of policy and regulatory reforms and technology breakthroughs, especially pertaining to the transition to cleaner energy pathways. As the Bank navigates through the evidently growing climate-related financial risks and other unknown risks, we recognise the importance of a fortified and resilient balance sheet and the need to build buffers from a position of strength, so as to safeguard against future unforeseen shocks and stress scenarios.\nProviding livelihood opportunities remains at the core of all our initiatives.\nIn Financial Year 2023-24, the Bank has met its CSR obligations. Your Bank has executed its CSR commitments through 210+ partnerships and over 260 projects across 28 states and 8 union territories.\nConclusion\nWe began the second quarter of the last financial year with the merger. As we concluded the year, we saw merger synergies starting to play out. This fills us with optimism for the current financial year and beyond. Especially given the anticipated growth in the Indian economy. We will continue to pursue profitable growth without sacrificing asset quality.\nLooking to the future, I’m confident that with the immensely talented and dedicated team at HDFC Bank, we will continue to innovate, drive sustainable growth, and make a positive impact on the communities we serve.\nI would like to conclude with thanking my colleagues across the organisation, for their sterling support and commitment to the Bank’s valued customers. My thanks also to our Board and all stakeholders, who have continuously supported us over the years.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nThe significance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) parameters can hardly be understated and we are fully conscious of the need for increased Board engagement\nThrough our CSR initiatives under ‘Parivartan’ we have impacted the lives of over 10 crore people. From upskilling farmers on scientific cropping patterns, providing placement linked training and mentoring of entrepreneurs, to supporting start-ups through incubators our consistent efforts have been to create an inclusive society.\nSashidhar Jagdishan Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer HDFC Bank Limited\n2 5",

In the first stage, the responses within each group were consolidated to derive the priorities for the respective groups.\nNext, the responses across different aspects were consolidated by assigning weights to each stakeholder group. The collective scores were then used to prioritise the topics as \"Most important\", \"Important\" and \"Less important\" (considering the reach of impacts within our value chain, magnitude of the impact, and likelihood of occurrence).\nThe final analysis was presented to the Board of Directors.\nIdentification of Material Topics\nMateriality Matrix Sign off\nWeighted Prioritisation\nIntegration into Risk Management Framework\nEvaluation of potential positive and negative impacts and reprioritisation of results\nAs part of our risk assessment process, we have mapped the identified material topics against the risk categories which are a part of our risk management framework. Of the 14 material topics, 9 have been identified as areas with opportunity and the remaining 5 have the potential to pose risk to our business.\nDrawing from the results of FY23, we further conducted a thorough analysis for assessing the economic, environmental and social impacts (positive and/or negative) associated with each topic. This was superimposed with the impact scores derived from the previous stakeholder consultations across two key dimensions reflecting impact of the material topics on the organisation (financial materiality) and society (impact materiality). After careful revaluation of 16 material topics, few topics were merged to derive a list 14 topics relevant to the Bank.\n3 9",

This transformation has brought forth not only numerous opportunities but also formidable challenges particularly in the realms of cybersecurity and data privacy. The landscape of cyber threats has undergone rapid and complex changes fuelled by targeted attacks, the proliferation of Ransomware-as-a-\nService (RaaS) incidents, the utilisation of AI/ML to orchestrate sophisticated attacks as well as the prevalence of DDoS attacks and coordinated group cyber assaults. The repercussions of cyberattacks are profound, impacting not only financial institutions' bottom lines but also their brand reputation and customer trust.\nMoreover, these incidents often result in attrition and significant financial losses. As the banking sector increasingly adopts cloud-enabled services as part of IT modernisation initiatives and digital-first business\nstrategies, concerns regarding related threats have intensified. Recognising securing the cloud entails a shared responsibility, organisations are actively implementing robust measures to safeguard their cloud infrastructure.\nRegulators in India are also actively taking measures to ensure data privacy.

Climate change and transition finance have become central to global discourse.\nIn addition, integrating climate and ESG related risks in underwriting policies and risk management framework is becoming increasingly important for financial services companies. The increasing threat\nof climate change and its physical damage are significant concerns that may impact portfolio performance. Shifting market perceptions and increasing demand for environmentally friendly products and services also have an impact on the cashflows of portfolio companies as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. Effective risk management is essential to manage and mitigate these impacts.\nMoreover, inadequate information about climate-related financial risks can lead to mispricing of assets and misallocation of capital emphasising the need for a better, more consistent and comparable disclosures. Globally, the publication of IFRS Sustainability Standards in June 2023\nis a step in this direction. Aligned with global trends, SEBI introduced mandatory reporting of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for top 1,000 listed entities in India in May 2021. SEBI also mandated assurance on select metrics in the BRSR to further enhance the quality and comparability of ESG Disclosures.

Alerts are generated for audit log failures based on asset risk levels. Monitoring tools aggregate log files, automatically reporting suspicious activity to the Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC) team.\nThe CSOC team performs the following:\n1.\nAnalysis and Incident Detection The CSOC team conducts analysis and incident detection by gathering information from system-generated events and other sources to identify potential incidents.\n2. Event Tracking and Escalation Events are evaluated according to their risk level and escalated as per the guidance provided in the Bank’s Incident Management Policy. This may involve referring incidents to the Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) for detailed analysis, forensics and management of situation awareness.\n3. Reporting\nThe CSOC team periodically reports the events and incidents to the senior management.\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR)/Malware Program\nThe program is designed to prevent, detect and respond to malicious code threats including viruses, worms and trojans by utilising a blend of proprietary tools and monitoring systems for mitigating these risks effectively. To ensure up-to-date protection, antivirus signatures are updated multiple times daily covering workstations, servers, email gateways and web gateways.\nVulnerability Management\nThe Bank oversees a proactive vulnerability management process that continuously scans for security threats. The dedicated team tracks and addresses vulnerabilities, logging and prioritising them based on severity and assigning ownership. They diligently follow up until resolution, ensuring thorough remediation of identified issues.\nPatch Management\nThe Bank implements patch management procedures and tools to evaluate and deploy operating system, network and application- specific patches and updates. This includes assessing vendor-supplied patches, documenting procedures and ensuring timely deployment to safeguard the Bank's infrastructure.\nPenetration Testing\nTo assess potentially exploitable vulnerabilities, the Bank conducts routine and ad hoc penetration tests on all critical networks and systems both internally and externally. These tests are initiated by various events such as new releases or updates. They encompass Network & Host Penetration Testing and Application Penetration Testing.\nNetwork Security\nThe Bank deploys firewalls and proxy servers to manage and segregate network traffic based on varying security needs and trust levels. Additionally, our Intrusion Detection/ Prevention Capabilities (IDS/IPS) swiftly identify and respond to known attacks in real-time. Regular updates to IDS/IPS signatures enhance detection accuracy for specific threats, intruder profiles and attack patterns. Configured to trigger alerts upon surpassing predefined thresholds, these tools ensure proactive monitoring and rapid response to potential security breaches.\nMinimised Surface Area for Cyberattacks\nThe Bank has implemented a comprehensive approach to cyber security featuring a dedicated Attack Surface Management Program (ASM) aimed at continuously identifying and addressing vulnerabilities across its assets. Significant strides include the institutionalisation of a cyber threat exposure management solution and establishment of a next-generation Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC) to predict and manage incidents proactively. Introduction of Security Orchestration, Automation & Response (SOAR) has notably reduced incident response times, while network micro-segmentation has enhanced control and visibility particularly against ransomware threats. Notably, the Bank has upgraded its monitoring and detection systems, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities, alongside robust User Entity Behavioral Analysis (UEBA) functionalities and threat modelling.

Projections from the Reserve Bank of India indicate a need for over H85 trillion by 2030 to align industries with climate regulations.\nRecent policy measures aimed at promoting green finance highlight India's proactive efforts in this direction. One notable advancement is the Government of India making its debut in the sovereign green bond space, issuing sovereign green bonds worth H16,000 Crore in FY23 and further increasing it to H20,000 Crore in FY24. Aligning with these trends, a jump in ESG investments by venture capitalists has been observed, signifying a growing interest in sustainable financing. Taking this forward, Banks and other lending institutions are also working to evolve their strategies to actively supporting clients' sustainability goals, streamlining green financing processes, and encouraging businesses towards a low-carbon future.\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has accelerated ESG transition by mandating reasonable assurance on quantifiable metrics for the nine principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct for the top 150 companies starting in FY24 which shall be gradually extended to the top 1,000 listed entities by FY27. Building on a decade of promoting sustainable development in banking, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also intensified its focus on climate-related issues in the past years, demonstrated through release of a discussion paper, \"Climate\nRisk and Sustainable Finance,\" in July 2022, and more recently through release of draft guidelines on climate-related financial disclosures in February 2024.\nOur ESG Strategy\nThe evolving landscape of ESG integration in the Banking sector necessitates a holistic approach that encompasses ESG aligned decision-making not only for our internal operational practices, but also extending beyond onto our external financing activities.\nAt HDFC Bank, we are committed to aligning our strategy with global benchmarks. Our previously established Social & Environment Monitoring System (SEMS) Framework for credit risk assessment for financing large industrial/infrastructure projects has now been replaced by a detailed “ESG & Climate Change Assessment Framework”. This framework operates under the auspices of our “ESG Risk Management Policy”, for integration of borrower’s current ESG stance and climate transition plans in our credit appraisal process. As we progress, we are also engaging with our wholesale borrowers to understand their current ESG strategy and long- term climate transition plans, with a view to tailor our corporate loan portfolio towards climate-sensitive financing.\nTo strengthen our strategy for climate risk assessments and tracking financed emissions, we are proactively aligning our sustainability and climate reporting frameworks to increasingly integrate best practices and comply with the extant regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. This keeps us abreast of the latest developments and practices in climate-related risk management, and serves as guidance to reshape our\nbusiness model and operations across different geographies.\nIn managing our internal operational practices, capturing ESG performance data remains one of our top priorities, albeit a significant challenge. This challenge stems from the distributed nature of our operations and is compounded by the diverse formats for data recording and the sheer volume of data to be recorded. We continuously engage with stakeholders to communicate ESG requirements and refine our data collection processes to progressively enhance data completeness and accuracy to better align with various reporting frameworks and formats such as the BRSR, GRI, IR, etc., while obtaining external assurance for key ESG performance metrics.\nThree years ago, we made a strategic commitment to achieve carbon neutrality on our own operations by FY32. We have, since developed and implemented a framework to guide us towards this goal amidst our expanding operations. The merger with erstwhile HDFC Ltd., in FY24, while unlocking exciting growth opportunities, has also prompted us to holistically reassess our performance milestones and adapt our course of action, ensuring that our carbon neutrality strategy remains aligned with this expansion.\nTo reduce emissions from all our operating locations, we continue to make informed investments encompassing operational and technological measures including IT capabilities and IT-enabled solutions. We shall continuously leverage these investments to optimise our data architecture and data governance practices, ensuring robust data collection strategies for informed decision-making.\n8 9",

The ESG strategy has set the foundation for the Bank to channel its resources towards sustainable projects. With ESG gaining momentum as a key factor in business decision making, the Bank is leveraging sustainable finance as one of its key ESG strategies in the form of enhanced environmental and social due diligence in lending and investment decisions thematic investing, ESG engagement and sustainable finance frameworks.\nDirecting capital towards sustainable projects allows us to integrate ESG as the fundamental determinant in our core lending strategy, and generate a positive impact through our business model. Being one of the key players in the banking industry, we recognise our role in facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy. With our pan- India presence and strong customer relationships, we aim to drive positive change by promoting environmentally friendly technologies and financing sustainable infrastructure projects.\nWe actively support the financing and investment in environmentally- friendly technologies and low-carbon infrastructure projects, leveraging our product offerings and financial expertise to assist our customers and clients in transitioning to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\nThe Bank has identified its products as one of the foremost business focus areas wherein ESG risks, and opportunities will be considered for improvement in systems and processes, taking into account the expectations from various stakeholders including investors and regulators.\nThe Bank is pursuing this through three thematic areas including ESG\nKEY TENETS OF\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE\nSustainable Finance Framework\nManagement of portfolio emissions\nESG Integration\nin Products\nintegration in products, sustainable finance and portfolio emissions. As the next step, long-term targets to strive to contribute to a more sustainable future are being set.\nESG Integration in Products\nWe have adopted a robust five- dimensional approach for steadily incorporating ESG factors into the design, development, and management of our products with the aforementioned “Environmental Social Governance Risk Management Policy”. This integration is guided by our board approved ESG Risk Management Policy that overlooks assessment, management and monitoring of material ESG risks in our lending portfolio in line with global ESG / Climate Change assessment standards and practices.\n“ESG Risk Management” framework, is a part of the overall credit assessment process for our wholesale corporate borrowers and has replaced the erstwhile “SEMS Framework”. This framework under the aegis of our ESG Risk Management Policy ensures thorough Environmental and Social Due Diligence of various loan proposals above the defined credit exposure thresholds, including direct\ncustomer loans (exceeding H100 Crore), wholesale loans (ranging from H50 Crore to 100 Crore), supply chain finance, offshore, and capital market loans (exceeding H50 Crore), as well as loans to banks, financial institutions, or NBFCs (exceeding H50 Crore).\nFor large project financing transactions, particularly those that are specialised and long-term, we conduct additional due diligence beyond the standard borrower-level assessment carried out in all Credit Approval Memorandums (CAMs). This involves the engagement of a Lenders' Independent Engineer (LIE) who evaluates various environmental and social aspects pertinent to the transaction. The LIE Report encapsulates identified risks along with suggested mitigation measures. Pre-disbursement compliance mandates the implementation of these measures, which are then continuously monitored throughout the project's implementation phase. Should any adverse developments arise, corrective action is promptly taken.\nUnder the revised framework, the assessment of ESG and climate change risks is also conducted basis borrower's overall ESG performance and climate change risks in relation to our total loan portfolio. This applies when our aggregate credit appetite surpasses a certain threshold, instead of evaluating each loan individually. The primary objective of this assessment is to evaluate the borrower's current position regarding ESG and climate change considerations so that we can analyze their transition plans and initiatives for mitigating risks associated with these factors. This assessment becomes a mandatory section included in Credit\n9 1",

We maintain a vigilant monitoring system for the identified KPIs and for the outcomes of new initiatives across all our operations. These KPIs encompass metrics related to energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water usage, and waste management.\nThe valuable insights drawn from the monitored data are used for decision- making and target-setting that propels us forward in our sustainability journey.\nWe are expanding our reach by opening new branches, particularly in unbanked semi-urban and rural areas; this expansion necessitates increased investment in infrastructure, personnel and technology to fortify data collection across all locations – which remains an instrumental component of our progress towards our sustainability goals.\nThree years ago, the Bank set an ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality on emissions from its own operations by FY32. Our recent successful merger and expansion is a significant achievement, which necessitates revisiting our strategy to ensure continued progress. While the FY32 target remains unchanged, the expansion has temporarily impacted data comparability between the current year and previous years – necessitating a potential adjustment to our interim targets on energy and emissions to reflect our growing footprint.\nOur Energy Performance\nAs a service-based industry, energy plays a critical role in our operations.

Electricity consumption from renewable energy sources is (i) generated through in-house solar rooftops installed at 25 locations and (ii) purchased ‘green’ energy for 12 locations. While some of our operations do use fossil fuel as primary energy (such as in generators for backup purposes and in company owned vehicles), majority (83.59%) of our energy consumption is in the form of electricity (2.54 million GJ). Most of this electrical energy is primarily procured from the grid-although we continue to look out for sources of renewable energy (RE) to replace grid energy, wherever feasible.\nIn FY24, our energy intensity stood at 9.87 GJ/H Cr Revenue from Operations, with a decrease of 3.68% compared to FY23.\nTotal Energy Consumed (million GJ)\nFY24\n2.54\n0.50\nFY23\n1.56\n0.41\nFY22\n1.31\n0.29\nFY21\n1.19\n0.21\nElectrical Energy\nEnergy from fossil fuels\nEnergy Intensity (GJ/H Cr Revenue from Operations)\nFY24\n9.87\nFY23\n10.24\nFY22\n10.15\nFY21\n9.58\nNote:\nEnergy intensity has been computed based on total revenue, which includes interest earned under Schedule 13 and other income, excluding profit/(loss) on sale of buildings & other assets (net) earned under Schedule 14 of the audited Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, we are integrating renewable energy sources into our power consumption, including through captive solar panels in certain offices, where feasible. Through the recent merger, our rooftop solar portfolio has expanded. We have now commissioned a total of 25 rooftop solar installations (14 added as a result of the merger), with a total capacity of approximately 720 kWp, resulting in avoidance of 451.83 tCO2e emissions from the provision of 631.05 MWh of electricity to our operating locations during FY24.

The observed increase in Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions prompts us to adopt a more holistic approach. We will be reviewing our baseline emissions and setting a new, post-merger baseline in alignment with base year recalculation methodologies of the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This comprehensive review and realignment will allow us to continuously adapt and strengthen our efforts.\n10 2",

The global fight against climate change has led to the advent of regulations like Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). This has spurred India to create a regulated carbon market, paving the way for the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), under the Energy Conservation Act. This scheme envisages both, compliance and the development of a voluntary carbon market. Some of the operational guidelines for CCTS are currently work-in-progress. To navigate this new landscape, organisations need to reassess their climate risks and become more climate transparent. Global guidelines like the IFRS S2 standard, which subsumes the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, present a framework for such disclosures.\nRecognising the growing concerns of regulators, investors, and clients regarding climate risks, particularly for banks and financial institutions, the Bank has been reporting on governance, risks and opportunities, strategy as well as metrics and emission reduction targets linked to climate change.\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued various draft guidelines on such disclosures, the latest one being the Draft Disclosure framework on Climate-related Financial Risks, 2024 published on February 28, 2024.\nWe are continuously striving to align ourselves to make increased climate risk related disclosures.\nGovernance\nBoard Oversight\nThe Board of Directors have increased their oversight on climate- related issues. The CSR and ESG Committee of the Board oversees the Bank’s sustainability and climate change initiatives. This Committee monitors the ESG framework, the\nEnvironmental Policy, actionables and initiatives strategised and executed by the management level ESG Apex Council and the ESG Working Groups.

The Bank has launched an internal pilot exercise to estimate financed emissions.\nDuring FY24, the Board received regular updates on matters such as key government and regulatory policy, regulatory engagement and ESG matters including areas such as progress on our climate strategy, policy updates, industry trends, stakeholder engagement and target- setting.\nThe Board members participate in dedicated familiarisation sessions to enhance their understanding of emerging climate related risks impacting the Bank and the adequacy of actions for management of the identified risks. In FY24, two meetings were conducted for the Board on emerging regulations and best practices related to ESG and climate risk management. The CSR and ESG Committee of the Board meets on a quarterly basis. During the year, the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee also reviewed key risks and opportunities arising from climate change.\nPolicies and Frameworks Guiding Climate Risk Management\nHDFC Bank’s approach to identifying climate-related risks, impacts, and opportunities is guided by the Board-approved ESG, Risk Management Policy (ESGRM Policy), Operational Risk Management Policy, Sustainable Finance Framework and the Environmental Policy.\nThese policies inter alia inform the categorisation of risks and implementation of risk mitigation and management measures.\nSpecifically, the Bank’s ESGRM Policy addresses climate transition and mitigation plans and includes a prohibition list criterion and ‘Category-A’ tagging of climate risk- related vulnerable sectors. As part of this policy, we use our ESG & Climate Change Assessment Framework as a part of the overall credit assessment for certain wholesale borrowers as per the ESGRM Policy. Under this policy, the Credit Appetite Memorandum assesses ESG and climate change risks associated with the borrowers’ operations and mitigation measures/ controls.\nThe framework also captures various aspects of ESG compliance and climate change risks/mitigants in relation to the borrower, and their business operations. Through the framework, risk exposures are identified and reported to management, thus enabling the implementation of necessary risk mitigation actions.\nThe Board-approved Operational Risk Management Policy outlines the governance structure and processes for managing operational risk. This structure consists of three lines of defense: the business line (including support and operations) is the first line, an independent Operational Risk Management Department (ORMD) is the second line, and Internal Audit is the third line. The Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (RPMC) of the Board oversees the risk management strategy of the Bank and ultimately reports to the Board of Directors.\nThe Bank had also implemented a Board-approved ESG policy\nframework, a guiding document for all ESG initiatives and activities undertaken by the Bank, focusing on climate change strategy, environmental and social risk management in lending, procurement practices, workforce and employment practices, good governance, and stakeholder management.\nWe have developed a Sustainable Financing Framework in line with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2021, Social Bond Principles 2023, and Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2021. This Framework, approved by the Bank’s CSR and ESG Committee, the RPMC and the Board of Directors, has also received a second-party opinion, concluding the credibility of the Framework as well as its alignment with global principles. This framework serves as a basis for the Bank’s on going and future Sustainable Financing Transactions (SFTs).\nA Board-approved Stress Testing Policy and System, which is an integral aspect of our ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process), is part of our overall risk management framework. Stress testing involves employing a variety of ways to determine our vulnerability to excessive yet realistically stressful work conditions.\nClimate risk stress testing captures financial impact of borrowers and associated credit losses due to physical risk and credit losses due to transition risk.\nCommittees Guiding Climate Risk Management\nWe have established a robust governance structure to oversee our ESG approach, comprising the CSR and ESG Committee of the Board\n110",

There are two main types of climate related risks:\nPhysical Risks: Extreme weather events like floods and cyclones can cause physical damage to property and assets, leading to economic losses (physical damage to property and assets). The Bank is assessing the potential financial impacts of these physical risks on the Bank’s operations.\nTransition Risks: The shift\ntowards a low-carbon economy may impact the value of certain assets and liabilities including the likelihood of formation of stranded assets.

Current regulations are also factored in the credit assessment process, especially through the comprehensive ESG and Climate Change assessment framework for its wholesale corporate borrowers.\nEmerging regulation\nTransition risk factor\nTransition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the climate policy, technology, consumer, and market sentiment during the transition to a low-carbon economy. This is particularly relevant for policy changes that can result in loan defaults from certain sectors like coal, thermal and certain infrastructure sectors.\nTechnology\nTransition risk factor\nWhile our digital environment and information security standards are the foundation of our business today, as financial services professionals, we do not anticipate technology to have a significant impact on climate risk. Our low-carbon digital banking products use technology to enable business.\nLegal\nTransition risk factor\nFor large loans, we verify whether the project complies with all applicable environmental rules, failing to do so could result in the loan becoming a non-performing asset if the project goes into litigation. This, however, is not a claim against the Bank. There are no other circumstances in which the Bank can be held liable for a climate-related lawsuit.\nMarket\nTransition risk factor\nIn the context of climate change, markets could play a key role in market repricing or shifting the demand and supply for certain products like green loans or bonds, or in low-carbon digital products. However, the Bank recognises the relevance of change in consumer preferences, and hence, the need to evaluate this risk.\n113",

From the perspective of climate risk assessment, we plan on assessing the priority of physical and transition risks in the near to medium term.\nWe have a three-pronged strategy to adapt to climate change: decarbonising our operations; managing climate risk & financed emissions; and financing the transition.\nManaging Climate Risks\nThe Bank's credit exposure is\nwell diversified across numerous industries, with no single industry having a high concentration.\nWe have strengthened the\nassessment of climate risks as a part of credit diligence, particularly in project financing above a certain threshold under the aegis of our ESG Risk Management Policy. As a part of this framework, identification of exposure for Category-A tagging sectors (business activities with significant adverse environmental and social risks) is underway. (Refer to the ESG Strategy chapter).\nWe are endeavouring to develop\nmore robust frameworks to measure and assess material climate risks related to our lending operations and apply a climate lens to more of our business decisions.\nWe are firming up an internal\nstrategy on conducting climate risk assessments and tracking our financed emissions. The Bank shall continue to expand the scope\nof assessment, and refine the methodologies basis the finalisation of the disclosure frameworks in India, including the guidelines and timelines put forth by the RBI. This shall also help in the development of the Bank’s targets on financed emissions in the future.\nWe have a Business Continuity Plan to address and manage continuity of critical business operations, ensuring accelerated resumption of services after a disaster. Financing the Transition\nHDFC Bank's Sustainable Financing Framework aligned to International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2021, Social Bond Principles 2023, and Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2021], serves as a basis for HDFC Bank’s future Sustainable Financing Transactions (SFTs), including green, social & sustainability bonds and loans. The Framework defines the eligibility criteria in ten distinct ‘green’ categories. The policy is available on the Bank's website.\nDecarbonising Our Operations\nMinimising our operational carbon footprint is central to the Bank’s sustainability strategy.\nWe are committed to effectively managing and mitigating the environmental impacts of our operations by adopting industry best practices and standards.\nOur comprehensive Scope 1 & 2 carbon neutrality strategy encompasses various initiatives, reflecting our commitment to sustainable practices and mitigating climate change.\n115",

This enables us to strengthen our strategy while ensuring a well-rounded approach to implementation of the same.\nClient Engagement\nAs a trusted financial institution, we continue to proactively engage with many of our larger corporate clients on both the risks and opportunities related to their businesses. To enable us to provide the appropriate advice and capital solutions, we also encourage clients to share and enhance their climate disclosures.\nThrough client engagement, our goal is to determine current ESG and climate change focus areas and practices. We strive to identify industry best practices and emerging\ninitiatives on ESG and climate risk issues, including short-term emission reduction targets, long-term net- zero goals, ESG and climate-related disclosures, and supply chain decarbonisation. Of the wholesale loans approved during the year, 26 per cent in value terms underwent an enhanced environmental and social due diligence as part of the Credit Appetite Memorandum.\nIndustry engagement/ Government/Public Policy Engagement\nWe believe that industry co-operation, particularly in setting common standards and transparent reporting, is important for all our stakeholders. We continue to engage with peers, industry experts and academics to assess the transition to a low-carbon economy and consider emerging methodologies and taxonomies.\nWe are member to a number of industry bodies and endeavor to advance our climate change policy through such industry/ trade associations.\nWe actively contribute to the processes of influencing the evolution of positions taken by trade associations through advocacy and negotiations. Our organisational strategy and climate goals guide our engagement with the trade associations.\nThe Bank also intends to accelerate the scale and pace of delivering value by using collaboration as a mechanism to effectively foster strategic partnerships with solution providers, civil societies, government agencies that would help bring together capabilities and resources to achieve its ESG objectives.\nRisk Management\nRisk Identification\nEffectively managing climate risk requires proactive identification, a thorough understanding of the domain, as well as comprehensive inputs from stakeholders. At the Bank, risk identification is an ongoing process that includes the consideration of climate-related factors such as physical (acute and chronic) and transition risks in the lending portfolio. We are actively seeking opportunities to enhance our capabilities in identifying these risks and their impacts on our business and endeavor to incorporate additional climate risk considerations related to sector, product, and geography,\naligning specific perils and transition categories, linking new and existing risks to other sustainability categories, and identifying the applicable time horizons for impacts.\nClimate-related Risk Management\nIn line with its sustainability- focused vision and commitments, the Bank has developed several initiatives to manage climate-related risks at the project, portfolio, and organisational levels.\nProject Risk\nAt a project level, a risk assessment focused on social and environmental aspects is integrated into the Bank’s overall credit approval framework.\nThe Bank’s ESG & Climate Change Assessment Framework, under the aegis of our ESG Risk Management Policy (ESGRM), ensures thorough environmental and social due diligence of various loan proposals above the defined credit exposure thresholds, including direct customer loans, wholesale loans, supply chain finance, offshore, and capital market loans, as well as loans to banks, financial institutions, or NBFCs. This assessment helps the Bank evaluate the borrower's current position regarding ESG and climate change considerations and analyze their transition plans and initiatives for mitigating risks associated with these factors.\n116",

The changes in the levels of Pillar I Risks and select Pillar II Risks, along with the changes in the on and off-Balance Sheet positions of the Bank are assessed under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and sensitivity factors. The suite of stress scenarios includes topical themes as well as historically observed geopolitical/macroeconomic/sectoral and other trends.\nFrom the perspective of climate risk assessment, we are exploring third-party frameworks to assess the physical and transition risks in the near to medium term.\nWe intend to integrate our climate strategy and the impact of climate- related issues into our financial planning processes, and to that effect, are developing processes and tools that will influence our business activities. We aim to:\nMeasurement of Financed Emissions: Pilot Study\nFinanced emissions refer to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are associated with lending and investment activities of financial institutions. As per the GHG Protocol, financed emissions are a specific category of indirect, downstream emissions and are classified as Scope 3 emissions. Financed emissions are critical to better understand the role of the financial sector in climate change. However, the lack of reliable and standardised India specific emission factors remains a challenge in measuring financed emissions. The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) provides a framework to help financial institutions report their financed emissions. While the PCAF guidance varies across different asset classes, the broad methodology for corporate\nloans revolves around the concept of determining the financed emissions of a given exposure using the concept of an ‘attribution factor’ and then applying it to the estimated emissions of the underlying company or sub-sector. Further, PCAF guidance is available for only a few asset classes, which poses constraints in determining overall portfolio level emissions. The PCAF methodology ascribes data quality scores from level 1 to 5. Level 1 data is where emission factors of the underlying entity has been verified by an independent third party. Level 2 data entails emissions that are reported by companies but have not been externally verified. Level 3 to 5 data is where emissions are calculated based on production level activity or sectoral /proxy data.\ndecarbonise our operations\nexpand our green and sustainable\nbanking products\nenhance the scope and accuracy\nof our climate scenario analysis and stress testing, applicable for the bank’s lending portfolio.\nmonitor and estimate our lending\nportfolio related financed emissions.\nAs disclosure requirements and regulations continue to evolve, we expect to take these into consideration while developing our financial strategy.\nAs a Bank, we recognise that we do bear some responsibility for the environmental impacts of projects and entities that we finance. We have on a voluntary basis, commenced the exercise of measuring financed emissions of the bank’s lending portfolio. We are working with a climate tech startup to help in the assessment of measuring financed emissions based on our lending to various industries/sectors. We are testing the efficacy of India specific sectoral emission intensities based on Environmentally Extended Economic Input-Output models.\nOn some of our corporate/ wholesale loans, it has been our constant endeavor to collect E&S information as per our ESG Risk Management Policy. While we recognise the challenges in collecting data on emissions, we are encouraged that a growing number of our wholesale borrowers are reporting Scope 1 and Scope 2 data.\n118",

Our reporting of financed emissions followed the PCAF standard for corporate loans as described below:\nAttribution factor = Outstanding debt/Enterprise Value 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = Σ 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑥 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (Enterprise value for a listed company is market capitalisation + borrowings)\nUsing the above-mentioned PCAF methodology, the sample pool totalling approximately H1.5 lakh crore had financed emissions of 12.2 million t of CO2e. Although it is acknowledged that the exercise is backward looking, rather than futuristic, it still represents a significant milestone in the Bank’s journey towards measuring and managing its financed emissions. The exercise has enabled the Bank to identify variances based on actual entity-level data of Scope 1 and 2 emissions versus applying sectoral level emission factors. This understanding shall help the Bank to establish more accurate baselines which will serve as the foundation for setting realistic and achievable emission reduction targets. Further, the Bank shall also continue to work towards widening its coverage for financed emissions, whilst also ensuring that it plays a role in being enablers of transition finance.\nOrganisational Risk\nThe Bank’s operations entail compliance and reputation risks, as well as ESG risks. To address these risks, the Bank has established an aggregate Risk Appetite Framework. Furthermore, risk-specific policies, limits and triggers are implemented to operationalise the appetites for individual risk types. The Bank recognises climate risk as a material risk. The Bank has a structured management framework called the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess, and manage all risks that could potentially have a significant negative impact on our business, financial position, or capital adequacy.\nMetrics and Targets\nWe have taken on an ambitious target for achieving carbon neutrality of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by FY32 and are already aligning our operations to progressively stringent internal benchmarks for enhancing our energy performance and integration of renewable energy. (Refer GHG emissions section for further details).\nAdditionally, we aspire to fortify our commitment to financing climate change solutions such as energy transition, renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, green buildings, climate smart agriculture, among others, and have already embarked on a process to examine our financed emissions and carbon-related asset exposure with the intent to develop KPIs and track the progress towards assisting our customers in transitioning to a sustainable, lower-carbon economy.\n119",

This SQI enables continuous improvement of initiatives to raise service standards.\nindependently review any customer grievance which is partly/wholly rejected by the bank before the final decision is communicated to the customer.\nCustomer Focus is one of the five core values of the Bank. Given a highly competitive business environment, especially with diverse lines of businesses, we continuously strive to enhance customer experience. Delivering exceptional product quality and customer service delivery is a prerequisite for sustained growth. The Bank strives to achieve this by seeking customer feedback, benchmarking with best-in-class business entities and implementing customer-centric improvements. We have adopted a three-step strategy regarding Customer Service - Define, Measure, and Improve.\nHDFC Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty through a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback system. This customer experience transformation programme helps employees to empathise better with customers and improve turnaround times. Branded as ‘Infinite Smiles,’ the programme helps establish behaviours and practices that result in customer-centric actions through continuous improvement in products, services, process and policies.\nOne of the basic building blocks of providing acceptable level of customer service is to have an effective internal Grievance Redressal Mechanism/Framework.

On the other hand, it has state-of- the-art platforms like NetBanking, MobileBanking, WhatsApp Banking, the chatbot Eva and the Bank's exclusive social care handles. The Bank also has a Virtual Relationship Management (VRM) programme to cater to various financial needs in a personalised manner.\nHDFC Bank has created multiple channels for customers to provide feedback and register grievances facilitating a transparent and accessible system. As a pioneer in innovative financial solutions and digital platforms, it has witnessed an increased utilisation of its digital channels. Keeping customer interest in focus, the Bank has formulated a Board approved Protection Policy which limits the liability of customers in case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions.\nBuilding a Customer- Centric Culture using Net Promoter System (NPS) - ‘Infinite Smiles’\nWe, at the Bank, believe that delivering an outstanding customer experience is a strong differentiator for a great product and is key to a sustained competitive advantage. The primary aim of the Infinite Smiles programme is to establish employee behaviour and practices which lead to customer- centric actions and continuous improvements.\nCustomer service performance and grievance redressal are regularly assessed at various levels, including Branch Level Customer Service Committees, Standing Committee on Customer Service and Customer Service Committee of the Board.

Women Retention and Engagement\nThe Bank has developed various initiatives and supportive policy measures which would enable us to ensure higher women engagement, offer them career growth opportunities, thereby retain women and build the leadership pipeline. Some of our key initiatives include:\nPleasant Parenthood Programme\nCareer Accelerator Programme\nStay Interviews\nThe ‘Broken Rung’ is a global phenomenon where diversity ratios across mid and senior levels in organisations drop significantly. This is because life-stage milestones often coincide with career milestones for women. In recognition of this, the Bank had introduced the ‘Pleasant Parenthood Program’ which is a slew of benefits for primary caregivers. This includes flexibility options, rating protection, wellness support and manager guidance. These policy measures are now becoming a ‘Way of life’ in the Bank.\nThe 'Career Accelerator Program' is our flagship initiative designed for mid-senior level women in the Bank. Given its success, we continue to run this program to maintain a robust talent pipeline of women advancing into senior leadership roles. Over 200 high-potential women leaders have been part of the CAP journey across two cycles. Sponsored by the DEI Council, the program focuses on authenticity and self-awareness, building a leadership brand, executive presence, influencing and networking.\n‘Stay interviews’ with select women employees across levels have helped us pre-empt support requirements and customise solutions at an individual employee level.\n14 4",

Our comprehensive reporting mechanism, which includes reporting our CSR projects in the Annual CSR Report, the Directors' Report within the Bank’s Annual Integrated Report and publication on the MCA website. This helps uphold transparency of our community initiatives. These reports meticulously follow the prescribed\nformat within CSR Rules, providing stakeholders with clear insights into the Bank's significant CSR activities and achievements.\nK945.31 crore\nTotal CSR Spend in Financial Year 2023-24\nThis year we conducted Impact assessments for our CSR projects with a budget of J1 crore or more.\nThe impact assessments considered the OECD-DAC criteria, which is widely regarded as one of the gold standards in evaluation frameworks. This framework assesses the project’s indicators by determining their Relevance, Coherence, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Impact and Sustainability. These criteria provide a normative framework used to determine the merit or worth of an intervention (policy, strategy, programme, project or activity). Other frameworks like the standard Outcome- Impact Framework was also followed to analyse and\nmeasure the outcomes and impact of the selected project by tracing the changes since the implementation of the project and establishing the causes of these changes.\nIn FY24, we conducted an impact assessment of 61 projects. Based on the assessment findings, several recommendations were proposed for the evaluated projects to enhance their effectiveness & accessibility, and to strengthen their capacity to scale, deepen and extend the duration of outcomes.\nWe also conducted evaluative SROI studies of two projects within the overarching theme of ‘Skill Development and Livelihood Enhancement’\nbased on actual outcomes that had already taken place. The evaluation was guided by the seven principles outlined by the SROI Network. The findings and observations from this study shall be used to formulate future course corrective actions and a strategy for scaling up the project.\nIn the following sections, we have showcased the results from select evaluations of our projects under each of the focus areas. A comprehensive repository of the impact assessments conducted during FY24 can be found here.*\nGRI 413-1\n16 0",

Currently, a considerable number of our initiatives are being implemented in such areas. Furthermore, we have ensured the coverage of 85 aspirational districts (out of the total of 112) through our CSR programs.\nThe World Bank defines rural development as the improvement in the social and economic environment of the rural population. The fundamental aims of rural development include planning, creating and using resources such as land, water and manpower to promote equal opportunity for the population reliant on them.\nGiven this context, Holistic Rural Development Programme (HRDP) strives to enhance the lives of people in rural communities by primarily bringing about sustainable socio- economic transformation and ecological development. HRDP adopts a comprehensive approach to sustainable development by integrating various interventions, ranging from Natural Resource Management, Education and Livelihood Enhancement & Skill Development to Healthcare. Targeted interventions for rural livelihood enhancement are also undertaken as a part of HRDP, including providing income-generating training for youth and women, creating alternate sources of livelihood such as livestock management, orchard development and promoting entrepreneurship activities like embroidery, masala making and toy manufacturing, among others.\nThis program focuses on a diverse array of activities including but not limited to enhancing the income of farmers, access to appropriate irrigation facilities, improving school infrastructure, providing access to potable water and irrigation, and promoting alternative energy sources such as solar, biogas and biomass energy. Additionally, HRDP encompasses the organisation of health camps, demonstration of sustainable agricultural practices, initiatives for soil and water conservation and financial literacy.\nFurthermore, our Focused Development Program (FDP), which is aimed at specific interventions and limited goals, assist us in achieving our objectives in a concentrated manner.\nUnder Rural Development, we have identified three key targets that we aim to achieve through our HRDP and FDP projects.\nMushroom Cultivation at Gaya, Bihar\n16 5",

Without basic financial literacy and inclusion, communities struggle to progress and engage with the broader world. Recognising this pressing need, we are committed to addressing financial exclusion by reaching out to the unbanked and under-banked populations in rural, semi-urban and urban areas across the country. As part of this effort, the Bank considers it a responsibility to promote financial awareness, particularly among marginalised sections of society, through various initiatives.\nAdditionally, we conduct financial literacy camps and support Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to promote financial awareness within communities. The primary objective of these initiatives is to empower individuals\nwith the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions about their finances, thereby enhancing their financial well-being.\nDairy Support\nThe dairy support program is instrumental in facilitating a substantial shift in the payment methods of farmers, moving from cash transactions to digital banking. This transition effectively addresses the challenges associated with managing payments in the dairy sector and navigating a farmer in mainstream banking services. Women play a significant role in the dairy sector, contributing to various aspects of production, processing and management. In many states, women are actively involved in milking cows, feeding livestock, and ensuring animal health.\nThis project is vital to rural development & financial inclusion, playing a key role in advancing\nthe progress and sustainability of the rural economy. This project further emphasises the larger CSR objective of Women Empowerment and facilitating their social and economic standard.\nBy fostering credit history and embracing digitisation, this program significantly elevates banking services for dairy farmers. This will also help in promoting healthy savings habits in farmers which is ultimately contributing to financial inclusion for the rural economy. Encouraging regular deposits, setting achievable savings goals and utilising interest-bearing accounts are effective strategies to build savings over time. By educating farmers on the importance of saving and providing access to financial services in rural areas, we can empower communities to secure their financial futures and participate more fully in the economy.\nWomen at the Parivartan financial literacy camp\n18 0",

Its performance is an outcome of its disciplined approach to managing risk and return.\nThe Financial Year 2023-24 was a historic one as the merger of parent HDFC Limited with and into HDFC Bank was completed. This merger strengthened our position as a leading financial conglomerate with marquee financial services institutions like HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited, HDFC Asset Management Company Limited and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company Limited becoming subsidiaries in addition to the existing ones, HDFC Securities Limited and HDB Financial Services Limited.\nComing to the macroeconomic environment, India is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in the world in the Financial Year 2024-25 with the RBI expecting GDP growth at 7.2 per cent.\nThe figures for the period ended March 31, 2024 include the operations of erstwhile HDFC Limited which amalgamated with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence the comparisons with the previous periods have to be looked at in light of the same.\nBased on Standalone Financial Statements\nThe income statement reflected a growth in revenue comprising Net Interest Income and Non Interest Income. While the former grew by 25.0 per cent, the latter grew by 57.7 per cent year- on-year. On an overall basis, Total Net Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2024, reached ` 1,57,773.5 crore, reflecting an increase of 33.6 per cent over the previous year.\nOver the past three years, the Indian economy grew on an average by 8.3 per cent and at 8.2 per cent in FY24. GDP growth has been supported by an increase in capital expenditure with the Government doing the heavy lifting. Inflationary pressures have moderated over the last fiscal year with retail inflation averaging at 5.4 per cent in FY24 from 6.7 per cent in FY23.\n200,000\n150,000\n100,000\nNet Revenue Distribution\n33.6\n49,241\n31,215\n50,000\n86,842\n108,532\nOn the global front, geopolitical tensions could act as a headwind for India’s growth and inflation outlook. However, while these challenges may pose some risks the resilience and momentum shown by the domestic economy in recent years suggests that it is well-equipped to navigate any potential headwinds.\n0\nFY 2022-23\nNet Interest Income\nFY 2023-24\nNon-Interest Income\nFor more details, please refer to the Macroeconomic and Industry section on page no. 220.\nNet Profit increased by 37.9 per cent to ` 60,812.3 crore from ` 44,108.7 crore.

Strategically\nplanning and coordinating 32 key workstreams, the committee ensured effective implementation and synergy, prioritising the minimisation of customer grievances and regulatory compliance. Looking ahead, the Bank’s focus remains on profitable growth.

        "content": "Management Discussion and Analysis\nMacroeconomic and Industry Development\nOver the past three years, the Indian economy registered an average growth rate of 8.3 per cent. India’s real GDP growth has been pegged at 8.2 per cent for FY24 as per the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO). The GDP growth has been supported by a boost in capital expenditure particularly in infrastructure development including roads, highways, railways and housing with the Government doing the heavy lifting. Additionally, private sector investment also showed some signs of resurgence in sectors such as cement, steel, oil and gas.\nOn the other hand, private consumption growth slowed to 4.0 per cent in FY24 from 6.8 per cent in FY23 and 11.7 per cent in FY22. To recall, post the pandemic, consumption had been driven by services along with high demand for premium products. However, as this pent-up demand effect waned and interest rates started rising consumer demand slowed down in FY24. Moreover, high food inflation and an uneven monsoon weighed on rural demand recovery.\nof supply chains out of China and to other emerging markets is likely to channel investment flows into India. Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast by 10 bps to 3.2 per cent for FY24 which bodes well for India’s economic growth. In addition, domestic consumer spending is expected to see some recovery particularly in rural areas as a normal monsoon, stable inflation and a reduction in interest rates support demand.\nInflationary pressures have moderated over the last fiscal year, with retail inflation averaging at 5.4 per cent in FY24 from 6.7 per cent in FY23. Although, retail headline inflation rose to a high of 7.4 per cent in July 2023 it has since moderated reaching 4.83 per cent in April 2024. Encouragingly, core inflation (retail inflation excluding food and fuel) has also dipped below 4 per cent signalling a disinflationary trend. Going forward, we expect retail inflation to average at 4.6 per cent in FY25 assuming normal monsoon. Additionally, a favourable economic base and controlled core inflation is expected to offer support. That said, weather related disturbances such as heatwaves, uneven distribution of monsoons along with a resurgence in global commodity prices remain a risk to the inflation trajectory.\nAs for the supply side, rise in manufacturing and construction activity has largely aided growth. The manufacturing sector has benefitted from improved profit margins due to lower input costs, while Government support schemes such as the ECLGS aided MSMEs. Further, favourable infrastructure and policy measures like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) and FAME 2 Schemes finally paid off for some critical sectors like automobiles, electronics (largely mobile handsets) and metals. Moreover, the construction sector has maintained an average growth rate of 13.1 per cent over the past three years supported by Government infrastructure investments and an increased housing market demand.\nEmerging risks on the global front could pose challenges to India’s growth trajectory and inflation outlook. Higher crude oil prices as a result of any escalation in Middle East tensions and tighter global oil supply pose a risk for domestic growth and inflation. Moreover, the impact of geopolitical tensions on global supply chains could hurt India’s exports to major trading partners and escalate costs. However, while global challenges may pose some risks, the resilience and momentum shown by the domestic economy in recent years suggests it is well- equipped to navigate any potential headwinds.\nFinancial Performance\nOn the external front, slowdown in global growth significantly impacted India’s exports of goods and services in FY24. However, expansion of professional and business services exports combined with diversification to new markets such as Central Asia and Latin America helped cushion the impact of the slowdown elsewhere in the global economy.\nThe financial performance of your Bank during the year ended March 31, 2024 remained healthy with Total Net Revenue (Net Interest Income plus Other Income) rising 33.6 per cent to ` 1,57,773.5 crore from ` 1,18,057.1 crore in the previous year. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in both Net Interest Income and Other Income. Net Interest Income grew by 25.0 per cent to ` 1,08,532.5 crore. Core Net Interest Margin was at 3.53 per cent.\nGoing forward, India is expected to remain one of the fastest growing economies in the World in FY25 with the RBI forecasting a GDP growth rate of 7.2 per cent. Economic activity is expected to be supported by a further surge in private capital expenditure and continued Government capital spending. Moreover, a higher allocation for Production Linked Incentive (PLI) sectors in the Budget for FY25 is likely to bolster manufacturing activity and attract FDI flows. In addition, a continued diversification\nTOTAL NET REVENUE\n33.6 per cent growth\nin the Financial Year 2023-24\n2 2 0",

Multi-function Terminals (MFTs), popularly known as Milk-to-Money ATMs, are deployed in dairy societies. The MFTs link the milk procurement system of the dairy society to the farmer’s account to enable faster payments. MFTs have cash dispensers that function as standard ATMs. Payments are credited without the hassles of cash distribution. Further, this process creates a credit history which can then be used for accessing bank credit. Apart from dairy and cattle loans, customers gain access to the Bank’s products including digital offerings such as 10 Second Personal Loan, Kisan Credit Card and Bill Pay. So far, the Bank has digitised payments at over 357 milk cooperatives across two states, benefitting more than 2.6 lakh dairy farmers. The Dairy business witnessed 142 per cent year-on-year growth in disbursements and 121 per cent in the book.\nDairy is the largest segment in the agriculture economy, and keeping this in mind, your Bank has created a separate team of agriculture specialists to cater to this segment. India, boasts of a substantial cattle population of over 30 crore, that offers a promising landscape for Cattle Finance as well as securing liabilities. The country’s agriculture sector, particularly the Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) segment, stands to benefit significantly in this scenario, with over 90 per cent of them falling within this category. Recognizing the potential for growth and financial inclusion, your Bank has initiated a strategic programme named ’Dairy Ki Pheri’.

In addition, factors like soil health, input quality (seeds and fertilizers), water availability, and Government policy have significant impact, along with price realisations and storage facilities. All this has an impact on farm yield and income.\nIn Financial Year 2023-24, the Bank has disbursed an amount of ` 8,786 crore to 2,47,533 farmers as Cattle finance.\nGiven the vulnerabilities, it is critical to strengthen climate resilience and adaptability of the agri-food sector.

Liquidity Risk, Climate Risk, Information Technology Risk and Information Security Risk have also emerged as critical considerations. These risks not only impact your Bank’s financial strength and operations but also its reputation. To address these concerns, your Bank has established Board-approved risk strategy and policies overseen by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (RPMC). The Committee ensures that frameworks are established for assessing and managing various risks faced by your Bank, systems are developed to relate risk to the Bank’s capital level and methods are in place for monitoring compliance with internal risk management policies and processes. The Committee guides the development of policies, procedures and systems for managing risks. It ensures that these are adequate and appropriate to changing business conditions, the structure and needs of your Bank and its risk appetite.\nThe hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is that it is independent of the business sourcing unit with convergence only at the CEO level.\nThe gamut of key risks faced by the Bank which are dimensioned and managed include:\nCredit Risk including Residual Risks\nClimate Risk\nCredit Risk\nCredit Risk is the possibility of losses associated with diminution in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties. Losses stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio value. Your Bank has a comprehensive credit risk architecture, policies, procedures, and systems for managing credit risk in its retail and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is managed on an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast, given the granularity of individual exposures, retail lending is managed largely on a portfolio basis across various products and customer segments. Robust front-end and back-end systems are in place to ensure credit quality and minimise default losses. The factors considered while sanctioning retail loans include income, demographics, credit history, loan tenure, and banking behaviour. In addition, multiple credit risk models are developed and used to assess different segments of customers based on portfolio behavior. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping exposures based on borrower group, industry, credit rating grades and country among others. This is backed by portfolio diversification, stringent credit approval processes, periodic post-disbursement monitoring and remedial measures. Your Bank has ensured strong asset quality through volatile times in the lending environment by stringently adhering to prudent norms and institutionalised processes. Your Bank also has a robust framework for assessing Counterparty Banks, which are reviewed periodically to ensure interbank exposures are within approved appetite.\nMarket Risk\nOperational Risk\nInterest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\nLiquidity Risk\nIntraday Liquidity Risk\nIntraday Credit Risk\nAs on March 31, 2024, your Bank’s ratio of Gross Non- Performing Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.24 per cent.

Digital lending has emerged as a convenient and quick method for customers to secure loans with just a few clicks often in minutes, if not seconds. However, addressing the risks associated with digital lending is crucial and your Bank has implemented appropriate measures to manage these risks effectively. Digital loans are sanctioned primarily to your Bank’s existing customers. Often, they are customers across multiple products, thus enabling the Bank ready access to their credit history and risk profile. This accessibility facilitates the evaluation of their loan eligibility. Moreover, the credit checks and scores used by your Bank in process-based underwriting are replicated for digital loans. This ensures consistency in the evaluation process.\nthe banking book. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance / limits set by the Board. ALCO reviews the policy’s implementation and monitoring of limits. While the maturity gap, Basel III ratios and stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, Net Interest Income impact and market value of equity (MVE) impact help mitigate interest rate risk in the banking book. This is reinforced by a comprehensive Board- approved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and interest rate risk.\nYour Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural pattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded options available to customers, which are used while managing maturity gaps and repricing risk. Further, your Bank has the necessary framework to manage intraday liquidity risk.\nMarket Risk\nMarket Risk arises primarily from your Bank’s statutory reserve management and trading activity in interest rates, equity, and currency market. These risks are managed through a well- defined Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign Exchange Trading Policy, and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in different trading desks or various securities through trading risk limits / triggers. The risk measures include position limits, tenor restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, Modified Duration of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Value-at-Risk (VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario-based P&L Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL) and are monitored on an end-of-day basis. In addition, forex open positions, currency option delta, and interest rate sensitivity limits are computed and monitored on an intraday basis. This is supplemented by a Board-approved stress testing policy and framework that simulates various market risk scenarios to measure losses and initiate remedial measures. Your Bank’s Market Risk capital charge is computed daily using the Standardised Measurement Method applying the regulatory factors.\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector. The LCR, a global standard, is also used to measure your Bank’s liquidity position. LCR seeks to ensure that the Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and immediately to meet its liquidity needs under a 30-day calendar liquidity stress scenario. The LCR helps in improving the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spill over from the financial sector to the real economy. Based on Basel III norms, your Bank’s average LCR stood at 117.35 per cent on a consolidated basis for financial year 2023-24 as against the regulatory threshold at 100 per cent.\nAverage Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n117.35 per cent\nLiquidity Risk\nOn a Consolidated Basis for the Financial Year 2023-24\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring unacceptable losses.

Framework and Process\nTo manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place a comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework, whose implementation is supervised by the Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) and reviewed by the RPMC of the Board. An independent Operational Risk Management Department (ORMD) implements the framework. Under the framework, the Bank has three lines of defence. The first line of defence is the business line (including support and operations).\nC.\nYour Bank has implemented sound internal control practices across all processes, units and functions. It has well laid down policies and processes for the management of its day-to-day activities. Your Bank follows established, well-designed controls, which include traditional four eye principles, effective segregation of business and support functions, segregation of duties, call back processes, reconciliation, exception reporting and periodic MIS. Specialised risk control units function in risk- prone products/ functions to minimise operational risk. Controls are tested as part of the SOX control testing framework.\nInformation Technology and Security Practices\nInformation\nThe first line is primarily responsible for developing risk mitigation strategies in managing operational risk for their respective units.\nThe second line of defence is the ORMD, which is responsible for implementing the operational risk management framework across the Bank.

This has opened up immense opportunities through the fusion of e-HDFC Limited’s home loan expertise with HDFC Bank’s operational efficiencies and wider reach. The amalgamation also offers huge prospects for cross sell. All in all, it is going to be a key driver for future growth. The under penetration of banking services in India is an opportunity by itself. HDFC Bank is well placed to capitalise on this given its inherent balance sheet and brand strengths. While chasing growth, the Bank will not lose sight of adhering to corporate governance standards, serving customers in a transparent way and treating employees fairly.\nUnclaimed Deposits of e-HDFC Limited\nThe Bank is a private sector bank registered with RBI and in terms of applicable RBI norms, deposits remaining unclaimed / unpaid for a period of 10 years, need to be transferred by the Bank to Depositor Education and Awareness (DEA) Fund maintained by RBI.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors\nIn accordance with applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (Accounting, Audit, Transfer and Refund) Rules, 2016, as amended, (the Rules) erstwhile Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (e-HDFC) till the effective date of the amalgamation i.e. July 1, 2023, has transferred deposits remaining unclaimed for a period of seven years from the date they became due for payment to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) established by the Central Government.

On such “in-scope” IT systems, we tested key IT general controls with respect to the following domains:\nWe have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems) which have an impact on the financial reporting process and the related controls testing as a key audit matter because of the high level of automation, significant number of systems being used by the Bank for processing financial transactions, the complexity of the IT architecture and its impact on the financial records and financial reporting process of the Bank.\nProgram change management, which\nincludes that the production program changes are moved environment as per defined procedures and relevant segregation of environment is ensured.\nto\nUser access management, which includes user access provisioning, de-provisioning, access review, password management, sensitive access rights and segregation of duties to ensure that privilege access to applications, operating systems and databases in the production environment were granted only to authorized personnel.\nProgram development, which includes controls over IT application development or implementation and related infrastructure, which are relied upon for financial reporting.\nIT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring\nand backup and recovery.\nØ\nWe also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant key IT dependencies within the key business process, which included testing automated controls, automated calculations / accounting procedures, interfaces, segregation of duties and system generated reports, as applicable.\nØ\nWe communicated with those charged with governance and management and tested a combination of compensating controls or remediated controls and / or performed alternative audit procedures, where necessary.\nOther Information\n5.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\nConclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant\n2 8 4",

However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n10. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n11. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n12. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nOther Matter\n13. The special purpose financial information of erstwhile HDFC Limited as at the day beginning of July 1, 2023 (i.e. the appointed and effective date for the Scheme) considered to give effect to the scheme as on that date was audited by other auditors, whose report expressing an unmodified opinion thereon, has been furnished to us by the Management. Our opinion is not modified in respect of above matter.\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\n14.\nIn our opinion, the Standalone Balance Sheet and the Standalone Profit and Loss Account have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Section 133 of the Act.\n15. As required by sub-section (3) of Section 30 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, we report that:\n(a) we have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary\nfor the purpose of our audit and have found them to be satisfactory;\n(b)\nthe transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank, other than those relating to leasing of immovable properties acquired on amalgamation of the erstwhile HDFC Limited with the Bank, as disclosed in Schedule 18 note 1 to the Standalone Financial Statements; and\n(c) during the course of our audit, we have visited 90 branches to examine the books of account and other records maintained at the branch and performed other relevant audit procedures. Since the key operations of the Bank are automated with the key applications integrated to the core banking system, the audit is carried out centrally at Bank’s Head office located in Mumbai, as all the necessary records and data required for the purposes of our audit are available there.\n2 8 5",

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date.\nManagement’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls\n2.\nThe Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\nAuditor’s Responsibility\n3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion\non the Bank’s internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements\n6. A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\n2 8 8",

Subsequent shifting amongst the categories is done in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Under each of these categories, investments are further classified under six groups (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures and Other Investments.\nPurchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted on settlement date except in the case of equity shares which are accounted on trade date.\nB BASIS OF PREPARATION\nThe standalone financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention and accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (‘Indian GAAP’), statutory requirements prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, directions, circulars, notifications and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) from time to time (RBI guidelines), Accounting Standards (‘AS’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, in so far as they apply to banks.\nBasis of classification: Investments that are held for resale within 90 days from the date of purchase are classified under HFT category.

Interest on non-performing investments is not recognised until received.\n2. Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions\nRepurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase (Reverse Repo) transactions are reported as borrowing and lending (lending above 14 days tenor reported as advances) respectively.\nBorrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted as interest expense and revenue on reverse repo transactions is accounted as interest income.\nLoans reported as frauds are classified as loss assets and fully provided for immediately without considering the value of security.\nThe Bank maintains general provision for standard assets including credit exposures computed as per the current marked to market values of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and gold. The Bank also maintains general provision for unhedged foreign currency exposures of borrowers, provision on loans to specific borrowers in specific stressed sectors, provision on exposures to step-down subsidiaries of Indian companies and provision on specified borrowers as prescribed by RBI. In the case of overseas branches, general provision on standard assets is maintained at the higher of the levels stipulated by the respective overseas regulator or RBI. The provision for standard assets is included under other liabilities.\n3. Advances\nClassification: Advances are classified as performing and non-performing based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific loan loss provision, interest suspense for non-performing advances, claims received from Credit Guarantors, provision for funded interest term loan and provision for diminution in the fair value of restructured assets.\nIn addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis makes provision on advances or exposures which are not NPAs, but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant environment or specific information or basis regulatory guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions and included under other liabilities.\nProvisioning:\nThe Bank classifies its loans and investments, including at overseas branches and overdues from crystallised derivative contracts, into performing and non-performing in accordance with RBI guidelines. Further the NPAs are classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets based on the RBI guidelines. Non-performing assets are upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.\nProvision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific loan loss provision for non-performing assets, possible slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general provision is categorised as floating provision. Creation of floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions are used only for contingencies under extraordinary circumstances and for making specific provisions for non- performing accounts. Floating provisions are included under other liabilities.\nSpecific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing advances is made based on management’s assessment of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI.\nThe specific loan loss provision for retail non-performing advances is also made based on the nature of product and delinquency levels.\nFurther to the provisions required to be held according to the asset classification status, provision is held for individual country exposures (other than for home country exposure).

The restructured loans are upgraded into standard category as per the extant RBI guidelines. Further, in respect of restructuring of loans pertaining to projects under implementation, the asset classification and necessary provision thereon is made in accordance with the said RBI guidelines.\n4. Securitisation and transfer of assets\nAssets transferred through securitisation and direct assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met with) and consideration is received. Sales / transfers that do not meet true sale criteria are accounted for as borrowings. For a securitisation or direct assignment transaction, the Bank recognises profit upon receipt of the funds and loss is recognised at the time of sale.\nOn sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than the net book value, the excess provision is credited to the Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum of cash received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption or transfer of security receipts issued by Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company (‘RC’) exceeds the net book value of the loan at the time of transfer.\nIn respect of stressed assets sold under an asset securitisation, where the investment by the bank in SRs issued against the assets transferred by it is more than 10 percent of such SRs, provisions held against outstanding SRs are higher of the provisions required in terms of net asset value declared by the SC / RC and provisions as per the extant norms applicable to the underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of these SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming the loans remained in the books of the Bank.\ncost unless it is more than the face value, in which case the premium is amortised based on effective interest rate method.\nThe Bank transfers advances through inter-bank participation with and without risk. In the case of participation with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued by the Bank is reduced from advances. In case where the Bank is assuming risk by participation, the aggregate amount of the participation is classified under advances. In the case of issue of participation certificate without risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued by the Bank is classified under borrowings and where the Bank is acquiring participation certificate, the aggregate amount of participation acquired is shown as due from banks under advances.\n5. Fixed assets and depreciation\nFixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site preparation, installation costs and professional fees incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability from / of such assets.\nDepreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of the fixed asset on a straight-line basis except for freehold land. The management believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, taking into account changes in environment, changes in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed assets. The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are given below:\nAsset\nOwned Premises Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) Electrical equipments and installations Office equipments\nEstimated useful life as assessed by the Bank 60 years 10 years 6 to 8 years\n3 to 6 years\nComputers\n3 years\nThe Bank invests in PTCs issued by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).

Translation of foreign currency items\nForeign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities. The USD-INR exchange rate for valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e. greater than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as well as relevant INR yield curve and USD yield curve. For other currency pairs, and non-deliverable contracts, the forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI) are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of the contracts. Valuation is considered on present value basis. For this purpose, the forward profit or loss on the contracts are discounted to the valuation date using the discounting yields. The resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Marked to market value of foreign exchange contracts are classified as assets when the fair value is positive or as liabilities when the fair value is negative.\nForeign currency income and expenditure items of domestic operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Income and expenditure items of integral foreign operations (representative offices) are translated at the weekly average closing rates and of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches and offshore banking units) at the monthly average closing rates.\nThe Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value, on the date on which such derivative contracts are entered into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet date.

Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.\nDividend on equity shares and preference shares is recognised as income when the right to receive the div- idend is established.\nIncome from units of mutual funds / AIF is recognised on cash basis.\nForeign exchange forward contracts and Principal only swaps (POS) not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in accordance with AS 11. Accordingly, such contracts are not marked to market and only translated at spot rate. The premium or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line basis as expense or income over the life of the contract. The interest income / expense on such POS transaction is accounted on accrual basis.\nLoan processing fee is recognised as income when due.

Revenue recognition\nInterest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account on an accrual basis, except in the case of non- performing assets which is recognised when realised.\nInterest income on investments in PTCs and loans bought out through the direct assignment route is recognised at their effective interest rate.\nThe Bank followed the intrinsic value method to account for its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect of options granted up to March 31, 2021.

The compensation expense is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account with a corresponding credit to Employee Stock Options Outstanding. On exercise of the stock options, corresponding balance in Employee Stock Options Outstanding is transferred to Share Premium. In respect of the options which expire unexercised, the balance standing to the credit of Employee Stock Options Outstanding is transferred to General Reserve.\nGratuity: The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees.

Bullion\nThe Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on a consignment basis.

Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares were exercised or converted to equity during the year.

Amalgamation of HDFC Limited\nThe Board of Directors at its meeting held on April 04, 2022, approved a composite Scheme of amalgamation (“Scheme”), for the amalgamation of: (i) erstwhile HDFC Investments Limited (“eHDFC Investments”) and erstwhile HDFC Holdings Limited (“eHDFC Holdings”), with and into erstwhile Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (“eHDFC Limited”); and thereafter (ii) eHDFC Limited into HDFC Bank Limited (“Bank”), and their respective shareholders and creditors, under Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 and other applicable laws including the rules and regulations. The Scheme was approved by the shareholders at the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) convened meeting of the shareholders of the Bank held on November 25, 2022. The NCLT, in accordance with Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rules thereunder, vide its order dated March 17, 2023 sanctioned the Scheme. Upon receipt of all requisite approvals, the Bank filed form INC 28 with Registrar of Companies on July 01, 2023 and accordingly, the scheme became effective on July 01, 2023. As per the Scheme, the appointed date for the amalgamation of eHDFC Limited with and into the Bank is the same as effective date of the Scheme i.e. July 01, 2023.

All assets and liabilities of eHDFC Limited have been recognised by the Bank at their carrying amounts as on that date except for adjustments to bring about uniformity of accounting policies as required under AS-14. The share capital of ` 311.04 crore issued by the Bank as consideration pursuant to the scheme has been adjusted against the corresponding share capital of eHDFC Limited of ` 370.29 crore and the difference has been adjusted to Amalgamation Reserve. Further, excess of cost over face value of Investment in shares of the Bank by eHDFC Limited of ` 14,006.31 crore has been adjusted to Amalgamation Reserve. Consequently, the Bank has recognised a debit balance of ` 13,947.06 crore in the Amalgamation Reserve as a result of these adjustments. The Bank has sought approval from the RBI to set-off the debit balance in Amalgamation Reserve by appropriating profit for the financial year ended March 31, 2024.\nSummarized values of assets and liabilities taken over as at July 01, 2023 in accordance with the terms of the Scheme is as detailed below:\nParticulars\n(` crore)\nAssets taken over\nBalances with banks and money at call and short notice\n5,408.87\nInvestments\n146,773.54\nAdvances\n605,664.86\nFixed assets\n1,442.60\nOther assets\n14,338.34\nTotal Assets (A)\n773,628.21\nLiabilities, reserves and surplus taken over\nEquity share warrants\n265.64\nEmployees stock options outstanding\n123.81\nReserves and surplus\n111,005.85\n3 13",

In terms of the AS-4 “Contingencies and events occurring after the balance sheet date”, the Bank has not appropriated the proposed dividend from the Profit and Loss Account and the same will be recognised in the year of actual payout post approval. However, effect of the proposed dividend has been reckoned in determining capital funds in computation of the capital adequacy ratio.\n3.

The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is expected to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.\nThe Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the Board. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance / limits set by the Board. The Bank has also set up a senior level management committee, viz., the Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC) under the ICAAP framework of the Bank, to establish a formal and dedicated structure to periodically assess the nature / quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk management processes, including providing oversight for managing liquidity risk. Liquidity for the Bank’s domestic banking operations is directly managed at the Head Office. The overseas branches and offshore unit of the Bank independently manage their liquidity requirements with support from the Head Office. Similarly, the Bank’s subsidiaries independently manage their liquidity requirements under guidance of the GRMC, which, along with senior management of the subsidiaries, reviews the risk assessment of material risks at the subsidiaries. Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to monitor liquidity requirements in other currencies as appropriate.\nIn order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail (which include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ` 7.5 crore), and Wholesale (which would cover all residual deposits). Other contractual funding, including a portion of other liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.\nThe LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period. The present minimum requirement, as on March 31, 2024 is 100%.\nIn the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities (viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of run-off factors and the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years:\nParticulars\nRun-off factors\nRetail Deposits\n5% - 10%\nSmall Business Customers\n5% - 10%\nOperational deposits\n5% - 25%\nNon-financial corporates, sovereigns, central banks, multilateral development banks, and PSEs\n40%\nOther legal entities\n100%\n3 2 3",

The average HQLA for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was ` 558,424.94 crore, as against ` 442,566.92 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. During the same period the composition of government securities and treasury bills in the HQLA was at 95.74% as compared to 89.95% in the previous year.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, derivative exposures (net of cash inflows) / collateral requirements and undrawn commitments constituted just about 0.59% and 1.54% respectively of average cash outflow as against 0.67% and 2.78% respectively for quarter ended March 31, 2023. The Bank has a significant portion of funding through deposits. As of March 31, 2024 the top 20 depositors comprised of 3.33% of total deposits indicating a healthy and stable deposit profile.\n3 2 4",

It could cover the natural hedge available to the customer as well as other hedging methods adopted by the customer to mitigate exchange risk. For foreign currency loans granted by the Bank beyond a defined threshold the customer is encouraged to enter into appropriate risk hedging mechanisms with the Bank. Alternatively, the Bank satisfies itself that the customer has the financial capacity to bear the exchange risk in the normal course of its business and / or has other mitigants to reduce the risk. On a periodic basis, the Bank reviews information on the unhedged portion of foreign currency exposures of customers, whose total foreign currency exposure with the Bank exceeds a defined threshold. A Board approved credit risk rating linked limit on unhedged foreign currency position of customers is applicable when extending credit facilities to a customer.

These include forwards, swaps, futures and options. The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks.

        "content": "Interest rate contracts\nForward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). The underlying rate of interest could be an interest rate curve, interest rate index or bond yield. There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date. The settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date discounted for the interest period of the agreement.\nInterest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified period without exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.\nInterest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest. The writer of the contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively. A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest rate collar, cap spreads and floor spreads.\nInterest rate futures are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock exchange to buy or sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such instruments or interest rates at a specified future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract.\nExchange rate contracts\nForward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on a future date. These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI rates or market quotations.\nCross currency swaps are agreements to exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies. Cross currency swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest payments in another specified currency for a specified period.\nCurrency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option) give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on or before a specified future date.\nCurrency futures contract is a standardised contract traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency on a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The contract specifies the rate of exchange between one unit of currency with another.\nThe Bank’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sale activities include the structuring and marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and exchange risks), within the regulatory framework as applicable from time to time. The Bank deals in derivatives on its own account (trading activity) principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations in price yields or implied volatility. The Bank also deals in derivatives to hedge the risk embedded in some of its Balance Sheet assets or liabilities.\nConstituents involved in derivative business\nThe Treasury front-office enters into derivative transactions with customers and inter-bank counterparties. The Bank has an independent back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines. The Bank has credit risk and market risk departments, as part of the Risk Management Group, that assesses counterparty credit risk and market risk limits, within the risk architecture and processes of the Bank.\n3 4 8",

The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position limits, tenor limits, sensitivity limits, scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss trigger levels and value-at- risk limits that are recommended by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’) to the Board of Directors for approval. All methodologies that are used to assess market and credit risks for derivative transactions are specified by the market risk and credit risk units. Limits are monitored on a daily basis by the mid-office.\nThe Bank has a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability & Appropriateness, which forms part of the Derivative policy, to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer’s nature of business / operations. Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank scores the customer on various risk parameters and based on the overall score level it determines the kind of product that best suits its risk appetite and the customer’s requirements.\nClassification of derivatives book\nThe derivative book is classified into trading and hedging book. Classification of the derivative book is made on the basis of the definitions of the trading and hedging specified in the RBI guidelines. The trading book is managed within the trading limits recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors.\nHedging policy\nFor derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge and the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument using various qualitative and quantitative methods.\nThe hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the Balance Sheet. In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow hedges other than for foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps, the changes in fair value of effective portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in accordance with AS 11. Accordingly, such contracts are not marked to market and only translated at spot rate. The premia or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract. The interest income / expense on such POS transaction is accounted on accrual basis.\nProvisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation\nThe Bank enters into derivative transactions with counterparties based on their business ranking and financial position. The Bank sets up appropriate appetite / limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its\n3 4 9",

Key Features and Objectives of Remuneration Policy\nThe Bank’s Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) is aligned to business strategy, market dynamics, internal characteristics and complexities within the Bank. The ultimate objective of the Policy is to provide a fair and transparent structure that helps in acquiring and retaining the talent pool critical to build competitive advantage and brand equity. The Policy has been designed basis the principles for sound compensation practices in accordance with regulatory requirements and provides a framework to create, modify and maintain appropriate compensation programs and processes with adequate supervision and control.\nThe Bank’s performance management system provides a sound basis for assessing employee performance holistically. The Bank’s compensation framework is aligned with the performance management system and differentiates pay appropriately amongst its employees based on degree of contribution, performance, skill, experience, grade and availability of talent owing to competitive market forces. Further, the Bank also considers compliance to processes, regulatory compliance and risk management as an integral part of its performance appraisal process. These factors are given due weightage for the purposes of the final performance rating of employees for a given performance year.\nThe NRC considers the aforementioned principles enunciated in the Bank’s compensation policy and ensures that:\n(a)\nthe compensation is adjusted for all types of prudent risk taking;\n(b) compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes;\n(c) compensation payouts are sensitive to the time horizon of risk; and\n(d)\nthe mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation are aligned with risk.\nReview of Remuneration Policy of the Bank\nThe Remuneration Policy of the Bank was reviewed by the NRC during the year ended March 31, 2024 and changes were made to the policy in accordance with the observations of the NRC .\nII. Design and Structure of Remuneration\nThe design and structure of remuneration in accordance with the RBI guidelines dated November 04, 2019, for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, is as follows::\na) Fixed Pay\nThe Remuneration Policy ensures that the fixed component of the compensation is reasonable, taking into account all relevant factors including industry practice.\nElements of Fixed Pay:\nThe fixed pay component of the Bank’s compensation structure typically consists of elements such as base salary, allowances, perquisites and retirement benefits.

        "content": "Overview\nIntroduction\nOur Performance\nHow We Create Value\nOur Strategy\nResponsible Business\nStatutory Reports and Financial Statements\nDeterminants of Fixed Pay:\nThe fixed pay is primarily determined by taking into account factors such as the job size, performance, experience, location, market competitiveness of pay and is designed to meet the following key objectives of:\n(a)\nfair compensation given the role complexity and size;\n(b)\nfair compensation given the individual’s skill, competence, experience and market pay position;\n(c) contribution to post retirement benefits; and\n(d) compliance with all statutory obligations.\nThe quantum of fixed pay for the Senior Management i.e. Employees in Executive Vice President and above grades, Material Risk Takers other than Wholetime Directors, Risk and Control Staff and Key Management Personnel are approved by the NRC and the Board.\nThe quantum of fixed pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC and the Board, and is subject to the approval of the RBI.\nb) Variable Pay - For Senior Management and Material Risk Takers\nThe performance management system forms the basis for variable pay allocation of the Bank. The Remuneration Policy of the Bank ensures that the performance management system is comprehensive and considers both, quantitative and qualitative performance measures.\n(i) Composition of Variable pay\nThe variable pay will be in the form of share linked instruments or a mix of cash and share linked instruments. The share linked instrument used in the financial year 2023-24 was the Employee Stock Options. All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by the NRC. For Wholetime Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.\nThe Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay. In cases where compensation by way of share-linked instruments is not permitted by law / regulations, the entire variable pay will be in cash.\n(ii) Limits on Variable pay\nA substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period)\nIn case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The non-cash component in 2023-24 comprised of Employee Stock Options.\nIn the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, his / her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.\n3 5 7",

        "content": "(iii) Deferral of Variable pay\nFor senior management including Wholetime Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements exists for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay is under deferral arrangements. If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus is deferred. In cases where cash component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements is not necessary.\nThe deferral period is a minimum of three years and is applicable to both cash and non-cash components of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs is governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules which is approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2023-24, the deferment of cash variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of Employee Stock Options.\n(iv) Vesting of Variable pay\nThe deferred portion of the remuneration vests at the end of deferral period and is spread out over the course of the deferral period. The first vesting is not before one year from the commencement of the deferral period. The vesting is no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting is more than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk.\n(v) Malus / Clawback Arrangement:\nThe Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.\nMalus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The RBI guidelines define malus thus “A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.”\nClawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of net amount. The RBI guidelines define clawback thus “A clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the bank in which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain circumstances.”\nThe malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting in financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide intent. Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all of the following conditions / events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement:\na) Substantial Financial Deterioration in profitability or risk parameters\nb) Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior\nc) Fraud that requires a financial restatement\n3 5 8",

Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case the bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.\nThe NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the variable pay.

The same has been formulated to comply with the requirements of Section 10D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and Section 303A.14 of the NYSE so as to recover certain compensation in the event of an accounting restatement due to any material non-compliance relating to any financial reporting requirements under the applicable U.S. securities laws, and shall be interpreted and applied consistent therewith.\n3 5 9",

For Wholetime Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.\nEmployees other than Senior Management, Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors\nThe Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:\n(i) Annual Bonus Plan\nThe quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the business unit, performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout.\nBonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum and the method of payout across functions.\n(ii) Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)\nPLPs are formulated for employees in sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given business / service targets but have limited impact on risk since credit decisions are exercised independent of these functions. All PLP payouts are based on a balanced scorecard framework which factors not just quantitative, but also qualitative measures, and are subject to achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are on the PLPs are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.\n(iii) Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs)\nEmployees in Job Bands D4 and above also receive ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between short term rewards and long term sustainable value creation. ESOPs play a key role in the attraction and retention of key talent.\nThe NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance rating, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC.\nAll plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by the NRC.\nThe Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees. Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months.\nIn accordance with the RBI guidelines, Employee Stock Options is included as part of Variable Pay.\n3 6 0",

These plans provide for the grant of units post approval by the NRC.\nSuch units vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months.\nRisk, Control and Compliance Staff\nThe Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions in order to create a strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict of interest between revenue generation and risk management and control. Accordingly, the overall variable pay as well as the annual salary increment of the employees in the Risk, Control and Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional objectives and goals. The Bank ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is weighted in favour of fixed compensation.\nGuaranteed Bonus\nGuaranteed bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance principles of the Bank and therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice.\nFor critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based on the performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost of attraction into the fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost implication for the Bank. For such hiring, the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account appropriate risk factors and market conditions.\nFor hiring at levels of Whole Time Directors / Managing Director / Material Risk Takers and certain employees in select strategic roles, a sign-on bonus, if any, is limited to the first year only and would be in the form of Employee Stock Options or Units (All units grants are subject to individual / Business Unit / organizational performance criteria).\nSeverance Pay\nThe Bank does not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (such as gratuity, pension) except in cases where it is mandated by any statute.\nHedging\nThe Bank does not provide any facility or fund or permit its Whole Time Directors and employees to insure or hedge their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in their compensation arrangement.\nStatutory Bonus\nSome employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 as amended from time to time.\n3 6 1",

Remuneration Processes\nFitment at the time of Hire\nPay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials of the incumbent.\nThe compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly, there could be certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval with appropriate justification.\nPay Increment / Pay Revision\nThe Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus on optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience, job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay.\nIncrements in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year. However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay during other times of the financial year.\nThe Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning for the purpose of retention of critical skills and critical talent in the domain of Information Technology, Digital, Information Security, Data Science as well as business segments that are strategic focus areas of the bank. However, such pay revisions are done on an exception basis.\nThe Fixed Pay for the Material Risk Takers (other than Wholetime Directors), Senior Management, Key Management Personnel is approved by the NRC and the Board. The Fixed Pay for the Wholetime Directors is approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.\nC. Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration processes, including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks\nThe Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes. The Bank follows a comprehensive framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long term incentives (i.e. Employee Stock Options).\nFixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively positioned in terms of fixed pay. The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed compensation are based on performance. The Bank also makes salary adjustments taking into consideration pay positioning of employees vis-à-vis market reference points. Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure that the talent risk due to attrition is mitigated. Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain proven cases of misconduct by an employee.\nVariable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below:\n3 6 2",

PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on the non-fulfillment of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks arising out of non-compliance, mis-sell etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are part of the PLP plans are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.\n(b) Variable Pay:\nThe Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to various types of risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk and market risk.\nThe framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the performance of the Bank and profitability. The annual variable pay is distributed based on business unit and individual performance and job band and role of the individual for non-business functions. The business unit performance is based on factors such as growth in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement vis-à-vis plans and key objectives. Bonus pay out for an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the performance rating of the employee and subject to meeting the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct.\nThe Bank has devised appropriate malus and claw back clauses as a risk mitigant for Whole Time Directors, Material Risk Takers, Senior Management (i.e. Employees in the job Bands of Executive Vice President and above). Under the malus clause the incumbent could forego the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. Under the claw back clause the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of variable pay payout pertaining to the reference performance year. The deferred variable pay is paid out post review and approval by the NRC and the Board.\nD. Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement\nperiod with levels of remuneration\nThe Bank has a robust performance management system for evaluating the performance of its Whole Time Directors. The performance appraisal system is based on a Balanced Scorecard Framework and considers qualitative as well as quantitative factors of performance which includes the following parameters:\n1. Business Performance - This includes business growth, profitability, asset quality and shareholder value.\n2. Stakeholder Relationship - This includes net promoter score and corporate social responsibility.\n3. Audit and Compliance - This includes internal audit reports and compliance with the regulations and\ninspection reports.\n4. Digital Transformation - This includes performance on initiatives required to run the bank and grow the bank.\n5. Organizational Excellence - This includes succession planning and employee engagement.\nWhile the above parameters form the core evaluation parameters for the Bank and the remuneration of its Whole Time Directors, each of the business units are measured on the following from a remuneration standpoint:\na) Growth in net revenue (%) over previous year;\n3 6 3",

These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the individual employee. For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating. The Bank strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time. All other things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the individual.\nVariable Pay\nBasis the performance of the business unit, individual performance and role, the Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:\nVariable Pay Plans:\nFor Employees in Job Bands of Sr Vice President I and Above (includes employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers, Wholetime Directors) the variable pay intends to reward short term as well as long term sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation.\nShort term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary.\nLong term Performance: Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating and job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank and creation of shareholder value.\nFor Employees in job bands Vice President and below:\nAt these levels the variable pay is primarily in the form of cash variable pay and is based on the annual performance. In FY 2023-24, the Bank granted units at E3-D3 bands based on their performance rating, grade and any other such parameter as approved by the NRC.\nThe Bank’s annual bonus is computed as a percentage of the gross salary for every job band. The bonus multiple is based on performance of the business unit (based on the parameters above), performance rating, job band and the functional category of the individual employee. The business performance category determines the multiplier for the bonus. All other things remaining equal, for a given job band, the bonus is directly related to the performance rating.

All PLP payouts are subject to the achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan, could be paid out monthly or quarterly.\nE. Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer\nterm performance\nFor employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers and Whole Time Directors the bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer term performance in the following way.\n(i) Limits on variable pay\nA substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay.\nIn case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The non- cash component in 2023-24 comprised of Employee Stock Options.\nIn the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, his / her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.\n(ii) Deferral of variable pay\nFor senior management including Wholetime Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements will exist for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay will be under deferral arrangements. If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus shall be deferred. In cases where cash component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements would not be necessary.\nThe deferral period would be a minimum of three years and will be applicable to both cash and non-cash components of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs will be governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules which will be approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2023-24, the deferment of cash variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of Employee Stock Options.\n(iii) Vesting of Variable Pay\nThe deferred portion of the remuneration will vest at the end of deferral period and will be spread out over the course of the deferral period. The first vesting would not be before one year from the commencement of the deferral period. The vesting would be no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting would be more than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk.\n3 6 5",

        "content": "(iv) Malus / Clawback Arrangement:\nThe Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.\nMalus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The RBI guidelines define malus thus “A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.”\nClawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of net amount. The RBI guidelines define clawback thus “A clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the bank in which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain circumstances.”\nThe malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting in financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide intent. Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all of the following conditions / events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement:\na) Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters\nb) Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior\nc) Fraud that requires a financial restatement\nd) Reputational harm\ne) Exposing the bank to substantial risk\nf)\nSuch other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering review by NRC for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement\nIn determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into consideration and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or whether it was on account of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes in legal / regulatory regime, force majeure events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other socio-economic conditions etc.\nWhile undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, the NRC shall be guided by the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event or misconduct.\nIn accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ arrangement. Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case the bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.\n3 6 6",

Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout.\nBonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum and the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher proportion of variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay.\nFor Employees in Job Bands of Sr Vice President 1 and above Variable Pay intends to reward short term as well as long term sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation.\nShort term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary.\nLong term Performance: Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating and Job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank and creation of shareholder value. The vesting period for Employee Stock Option is 4 years.\nThe Bank also granted Restricted Stock Units (Units) to employees at E3-D3 bands in FY23-24. The units would vest over 4 years.\n3 6 7",

This roadmap required these institutions to prepare IND-AS based financial statements for the accounting periods beginning April 01, 2018 with comparatives for the periods beginning April 01, 2017. The implementation of IND-AS by banks requires certain legislative changes in the format of financial statements to comply with the disclosures required under IND-AS.

The legislative amendments recommended by the RBI are under consideration by the Government of India. Accordingly, the RBI, through its circular dated March 22, 2019, deferred the implementation of IND-AS until further notice.\n3 72",

The Bank expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions on similar issues in the previous years by the appellate authorities, based on the facts of the case and taxation laws.\n2\nClaims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts - others\nThe Bank is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Bank does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.\n3\nPartly paid investments\nThis represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments.\n4\nLiability on account of forward exchange and derivative contracts\nThe Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants on its own account and for customers.

Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest / principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms.\n5\nGuarantees given on behalf of constituents, acceptances, endorsements and other obligations\nAs a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing of the Bank’s customers.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\nAuditor’s Responsibility\n3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group’s internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI.

A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Group; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Group are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Group; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Group’s assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion\n8.\nIn our opinion, the Group, has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to Consolidated Financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Group considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.\nOther Matters\n9.

The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Group’s exposure to credit or price risks.

Unequivocally, the business of banking is underpinned by trust and as a responsible lender, the Bank stands committed to contributing to nation building.\nWith concerted effort, the Bank has seen a significant improvement in its diversity and retention ratios which augurs well. The Bank is committed to playing a meaningful role in supporting the government’s flagship schemes – be it micro-insurance, pensions, MSME funding and initiatives in digitalisation, agriculture, healthcare, livelihoods, amongst others. The Bank was awarded the ‘Conscious Corporate of the Year’ at the ET Awards, 2023 – an acknowledgement of our efforts on Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG.\nFY 2023-24 marks an exceptional year, as it is the first year of reporting post the merger of the erstwhile Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (e-HDFC) with HDFC Bank with effect from July 1, 2023. The rationale for the merger has been well articulated as have the synergies of the combined entity. Given the scale of the merger, as with the financials, there is a new starting point for non-financial metrics as well. Thus, the current year’s numbers are not comparable with that of the prior period.\nDuring the year, the Bank raised its maiden international sustainable bond, which was well received by investors. The Bank has widened its coverage of wholesale loans that undergo Environmental and Social due diligence. Leveraging on the deep corporate relationships, the Bank recognises the importance of being enablers of transition financing to shift to cleaner energy pathways.\nPrior to the merger, an Integration Committee was set up to facilitate a seamless and effective integration. Having spearheaded the Integration Committee, suffice to say that ESG was among the core focus areas. Culture, people, processes and systems are the key pillars of building long- term sustainable businesses.\nThe Bank is committed to raising the bar on its ESG disclosures. More importantly, the Bank abides by the principles of integrity, transparency and accountability in its ESG reporting.\nThe board believes that governance and sustainability are inextricably linked and essential to ensure long-term value creation. Though ESG frameworks are still evolving, the Board is committed to deepening its oversight on ESG and climate- related disclosures.\nKaizad Bharucha Deputy Managing Director\n5 2 7",

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.\nYes. The Bank is cognisant of its impact on the environment and is actively engaged in reducing its energy consumption and emissions across its operations. Automated energy management solutions are deployed at some of the branches, which helps monitor energy consumption and control usage. This initiative is now active at 568 branches and has resulted in savings of 16% on electricity, amounting to about 4.19 million units (kWh) in FY 23-24.\nImplementation of static Power Factor (PF) solutions through the installation of Active Harmonic Filter (AHF) was another project rolled out in FY 23-24 that aims to address the correction of power factor and bring in efficiencies at the branch locations. The project was implemented at 86 locations and electricity savings amounted to close to 0.16 million units (kWh) in FY 23-24.\nWherever feasible, the Bank has also been trying to integrate renewable energy sources into the overall power consumption. The Bank has 25 rooftop solar plants with a cumulative capacity of about 720 kWp across the country. The Bank also procures green power at a premium tariff through DISCOMs at 12 locations in Maharashtra. With the procurement of over 2,639.18 MWh during FY 23-24, about 1,889.66 metric tonnes of carbon emissions were avoided during the year. To adopt a more holistic approach to emission reduction, the Bank has been evaluating all new projects for feasibility of green certification by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). As of March 31, 2024, 2,026 branches and offices received green certifications from IGBC.\n5 6 3",

The Bank has formulated an internal Standard Operating Procedure to document its approach to waste segregation and handling in the office premises. The Bank segregates and recycles dry waste at select large offices. The dry waste from these offices is collected and disposed through authorised vendors who eventually recycle the waste. In FY 23-24, disposal of the Bank’s owned IT assets within its premises and its co-located datacenters led to the generation and recycling of 110.58 tonnes of e-waste and 20.51 tonnes of battery waste. The e-waste and battery waste was handed over to authorized recyclers, thus ensuring circularity.\n11.\nIf the entity has operations / offices in / around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal regulation zones etc.) where environmental approvals/clearances are required, please specify details.\nGiven the nature of the business, the Bank does not have any operations or offices in ecologically sensitive areas.\n12.
