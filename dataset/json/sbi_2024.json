With IMF projecting the world economy to continue growing at 3.2% during 2024, the growth prospects of India look promising in FY2025.",

        "content": "Economic Backdrop and Banking Environment Global Economic Scenario The global economy in FY2024 displayed remarkable resilience despite repeated shocks and unprecedented monetary tightening. Although no resolution appears at sight for the ongoing geopolitical tensions, FY2024 also witnessed supply disruptions in key shipping routes along the Red Sea.\nGrowth in the US and several major emerging market economies (EMEs) has held up better than expected. While the manufacturing activity has remained subdued, services have exhibited strength. The rise in the cost of liquidity in major currencies did not result in significant economic downturn as was expected. The entrenched inflation seen in most of the advanced economies and emerging market economies has now come down although the decline in core and services inflation is slow amidst continuing tightness in labour markets.\nMajor central banks in advanced economies have kept policy rates on hold to ensure aligning of inflation with targets and it is expected that Federal Reserve, Bank of England and European Central Bank may not change the rating stance in the near term.\nThe IMF expects the world economy to expand at 3.2 percent during 2024. Global inflation is forecast to decline steadily, from 6.8 percent in 2023 to 5.9 percent in 2024 and 4.5 percent in 2025 with advanced economies returning to their inflation targets sooner than emerging markets and developing economies.\nRisks to the global outlook are broadly balanced in FY2025. On the downside, new price spikes stemming from the geopolitical tensions, including those from the war in\nUkraine and the conflict in Gaza and Israel, along with persistent tight labour markets could raise interest rate expectations. A divergence in disinflation speeds among major economies could cause currency movements that may put financial sectors under pressure.\nIndia’s Economic Scenario Amidst the global challenges, the Indian economy has stayed resilient and has emerged as the fastest growing major economy of the world in FY2024 for the third successive year. The National Statistical Office’s (NSO) advanced estimates placed real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 7.6% for FY2024, supported by an upturn in the investment cycle on the back of the Government’s continued thrust on capital expenditure, higher capacity utilisation, underlying resilience of the services sector, double digit credit growth and healthier corporate and bank balance sheets.\nFY2024 Second Advance Estimates reveal that Real Gross Value Added (GVA) in agriculture and allied activities is expected to grow by 0.7% in FY2024 (4.7% growth a year ago) on account of decline in foodgrains production during the kharif season. The industrial sector has strengthened further and is expected to grow at 9.0% in FY2024 as against 2.1% in FY2023 aided by strong activity across all sub-sectors. The services sector has maintained its momentum in FY2024 with an impetus from trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting and financial, real estate and professional services. The services sector is expected to grow at 7.5% on the top of 10% growth a year ago. GST collections in FY2024 at around H20 trillion as compared to H18 trillion in FY2023 points towards robust domestic trading activity with monthly collections crossing the H2 trillion mark in April 2024.\nIndia’s external demand exhibited signs of slowdown owing to protracted geopolitical tensions. Overall, merchandise exports declined by 3.1% during FY2024, while merchandise imports weakened by 5.4%. However, the current account deficit narrowed sharply to 1.2% of GDP in FY2024 (9-month period) from 3.6% in the corresponding period last fiscal with an improvement in the net services trade and an increase in net transfer receipts.\ninflation has been on a Headline moderating path during FY2024 with food price pressures interrupting the descent even as core inflation softened across its goods and services components. Industrial and farm input price pressures remain muted and organised sector wage growth stayed steady. Average CPI inflation stood at 5.4% in FY2024 as compared to 6.7% in FY2023.\nBanking Business With marked improvement in economic activities, ASCB’s credit growth has remained robust in FY2024, clocking growth of 20.2% (H27.59 Lakh Crore) compared to 15.0% growth (H17.83 Lakh Crore) recorded in FY2023. Aggregate deposits grew by 13.5% (H24.3 Lakh Crore) in FY2024, compared to 9.6% growth (H15.78 Lakh Crore) in FY2023. Excluding asymmetry due to HDFC merger, ASCB’s credit grew by 16.3% (H22.28 Lakh Crore), while deposits grew by 12.9% (H23.2 Lakh Crore) in FY2024. Though RBI kept the policy repo rate unchanged in FY2024, the tight system liquidity, as also gradual transmission of rates, has pushed up both the deposit and lending rates of the banks. Growth in unsecured personal loans showed deceleration post the increase in risk weights on select segments by RBI in November 2023.\n36",

The market risk parameters (Greek limits, Loss limits, Cut-loss triggers, Open position limits, VaR, Modified Duration, PV01, etc.) have been clearly defined in the Policy which are strictly adhered to. For containing Credit risk, the policy stipulates customer / counterparty eligibility criteria [credit rating, tenure of relationship, availability of CEL limit, Customer Appropriateness & Suitability (CAS) testing etc.] which are strictly complied. Appropriate limits are set for the corporate counterparties by respective Business Units considering their ability to honour obligations. The Bank executes ISDA agreement with each derivatives counterparty – both corporate as well as interbank.\nFor each of the Interbank counterparty, a counterparty exposure limit is put in place by the Risk vertical. The Bank has executed CSA (Credit Support Annex) – a part of ISDA Master Agreement with a few counterparties. As per the terms of CSA, collateral is posted or transferred with swap counterparties to mitigate the credit risk arising from ‘in the money’ derivative positions.\nThe Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of the Bank oversees efficient management of these risks.

MRMD assists ALCO in controlling and managing these risks and reports compliance with policy prescriptions to the Risk Management Committee of the Board (RMCB) at regular intervals.\nThe accounting policy for derivatives has been drawn up in accordance with the RBI guidelines, the details of which are presented under Schedule 17: Principal Accounting Policies (PAP).\nDisclosures as Required under SEBI (LODR) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (Listing Regulations) 1.\nThe Central Board of the Bank has reviewed and approved the terms of reference/ role/ reconstitution of various Board level committees viz Audit, Stakeholders Relationship, Risk Management and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, respectively, in terms of amendment in SEBI (LODR) Regulations.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. The impact of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognised in the profit and loss account. Deferred tax assets are recognised and re-assessed at each reporting date, based upon management’s judgement as to whether their realisation is considered as reasonably certain. Deferred Tax Assets are recognised on carry forward of unabsorbed depreciation and tax losses only if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that such deferred tax assets can be realised against future profits.\n14\nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n14.1 In conformity with AS 29, “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the Bank recognises provisions only when it has a present obligation because of a past event, and would result in a probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n14.2 No provision is recognised for:\ni.\nany possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Bank; or\nii.\nany present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:\na.\nit is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or\nb.\na reliable estimate of the amount of obligation cannot be made.\nSuch obligations are recorded as Contingent Liabilities.

Average HQLA held during the quarter was H13,13,148 Crore, with 96.50% being Level 1 assets. Level 2A and Level 2B assets constitute 2.84% and 0.66% of total HQLA, respectively. Government Securities constituted 94.34% of Total Level 1 Assets. During the quarter, the weighted average HQLA level got reduced by H94,877 Crore primarily on account of decline in excess SLR balance. Further, the weighted average net cash outflows position remained almost at the same level with a negligible fall by H4,104 Crore during the quarter. Derivative exposures are considered insignificant due to almost matching inflows and outflows position. During the quarter, LCR for USD (significant Foreign Currency constituting more than 5% of the Balance Sheet of the Bank) was at 413.69%, on an average.\nLiquidity Management in the Bank is driven by the ALM Policy of the Bank and regulatory prescriptions. The Domestic and International Treasuries are apprising the liquidity position to the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of the Bank. The ALCO has been empowered by the Bank’s Board to formulate the Bank’s funding strategies to ensure that the funding sources are well diversified and is consistent with the operational requirements of the Bank. All the major decisions of ALCO are being reported to the Bank’s Board subsequently. Besides daily/monthly LCR reporting, Bank also prepares daily Structural Liquidity statements to assess the liquidity needs of the Bank on an ongoing basis.\nThe Bank has been maintaining HQLA mainly in the form of SLR investments over and above the mandatory requirements. Retail deposits constitute major portion of total funding sources, which are well diversified. Management is of the view that the Bank has sufficient liquidity cover to meet its likely future commitments.\nii. Consolidated LCR\nThe RBI through a supplementary guideline issued on March 31, 2015 had stipulated the implementation of LCR at a consolidated level from January 1, 2016 and accordingly, LCR has been computed at Group level. The entities covered in the Group LCR are SBI and seven Overseas Banking Subsidiaries (OBS) - Commercial Indo Bank LLC, Moscow, Nepal SBI Bank Ltd., State Bank of India (California), SBI Canada Bank, State Bank of India (Mauritius) Ltd, PT Bank SBI Indonesia and State Bank of India (UK) Ltd. and one Non Banking Subsidiary (NBS) - SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd.\nSBI Group LCR comes to 130.62% as on 31st March 2024 based on average of three months January, February and March 2024, which is above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%. The Group has been maintaining HQLA mainly in the form of SLR investments over and above the mandatory requirements. Retail deposits constitute major portion of total funding sources, and such funding sources are well diversified. Management is of the view that the Bank has sufficient liquidity cover to meet its likely future short-term requirements.\n187",

Accounting Standard – 29 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”:\nDescription of Contingent liabilities: Sr. No.\nParticulars\nBrief Description\n1\nClaims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts\nThe Bank is a party to various proceedings in the normal course of business. The Bank does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Bank's financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows. The Bank is also a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are pending.\n2\nLiability on partly paid-up investments/ Venture Funds\nThis item represents amounts remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments. This also includes undrawn commitments for Venture Capital Funds.\n3\nLiability on account of outstanding forward exchange contracts\nThe Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts in its normal course of business to exchange currencies at a pre-fixed price at a future date. Forward exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate. The notional amounts are recorded as Contingent Liabilities. With respect to the transactions entered into with its customers, the Bank generally enters into off-setting transactions in the interbank market. This results in generation of a higher number of outstanding transactions, and hence a large value of gross notional principal of the portfolio, while the net market risk is lower.\n4\ngiven on Guarantees behalf constituents, of acceptances, endorsements and other obligations\nAs a part of its commercial Banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credits and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits enhance the credit standing of the customers of the Bank. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payment in the event of the customer failing to fulfil its financial or performance obligations.\n5\nOther items for which the Bank is contingently liable\nThe Bank enters into currency options, forward rate agreements, currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-Bank participants on its own account and for customers. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest/principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates.

These are further categorised as secured by Tangible assets (including advances against Book Debts), covered by Bank/Government Guarantees and Unsecured advances.\na.\nThe accuracy of the data input in the system for income recognition, classification into performing and non performing Advances and provisioning in accordance with the IRAC norms in respect of the branches audited by us;\nAdvances constitute 59.94% of the Bank’s total assets. They are, inter-alia, governed by income recognition, asset classification and provisioning (IRAC) norms and other circulars and directives issued by the RBI from time to time which provides guidelines related to classification of Advances into performing and non- performing Advances (NPA) except in case of foreign offices, classification of advances and provisioning thereof is made as per local regulations or RBI guidelines, whichever is more stringent. The Bank classifies these Advances based on IRAC norms as per its accounting policy No. 3.\nIdentification of performing and non-performing Advances involves establishment of proper mechanism. The Bank accounts for all the transactions related to Advances in its Information Technology System (IT System) viz. Core Banking Solution (CBS) which identifies whether the advances are performing or non- performing.\nFurther, NPA classification and calculation of provision (except in case of foreign offices) is done through another IT System viz. Centralised Credit Data Processing (CCDP) Application Software and other processes.\nThe carrying value of these advances (net of provisions) may be materially misstated if, either individually or in aggregate, the IRAC norms are not properly followed.\nConsidering the nature of the transactions, regulatory requirements, existing business environment, estimation/ judgement involved in valuation of securities and calculation of provisions, it is a matter of high importance for the intended users of the Standalone Financial Statements.

The Bank’s assessment is supported by the facts of matter, their own judgement, past experience, and advice from legal and independent tax consultants wherever considered necessary. Accordingly, unexpected adverse outcomes may significantly impact the Bank’s reported profit and state of affairs presented in the Balance Sheet.\nb.\nc.\nUnderstanding litigations/tax assessments including the status up to the date of auditor’s report;\nthe current status of\nthe\nExamining recent orders and/or communication received from various tax authorities/ judicial forums and follow up action thereon;\nWe determined the above area as a Key Audit Matter in view of associated uncertainty relating to the outcome of these matters which requires application of judgement in interpretation of law. Accordingly, our audit was focused on analysing the facts of subject matter under consideration and judgements/ interpretation of law involved.\nd.\nEvaluating the merit of the subject matter under consideration with reference to the grounds presented therein and available independent legal / tax advice including opinion of our internal tax experts;\ne.\nReview and analysis of evaluation of the contentions of the Bank through discussions, collection of details of the subject matter under consideration, the likely outcome and consequent potential outflows on those issues; and\nf.\nVerification of disclosures related to significant litigations and taxation matters.\niv\nValuation of employees’ defined benefit obligations:\nThe Bank has recognised long-term defined benefit obligations for its employees on actuarial basis. Pension and gratuity obligations are funded by the Bank. Shortfall, if any, in Bank’s Provident Fund Scheme is also provided for on actuarial basis. The Bank makes periodic contributions to fund administered by Trustees based on an independent external actuarial valuation carried out annually. Unfunded long-term defined benefit obligations are compensated absences, silver jubilee award, leave travel concession, retirement award and resettlement allowance. The cost of providing unfunded long-term benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each Balance Sheet date.\nWe tested governance and controls in place over the methodologies and the significant assumptions, including those in relation to the use of management's experts. We examined the reports of external actuarial specialist and reviewed the key actuarial assumptions used, both financial and demographic, and considered the methodology applied to derive these assumptions including review of input data provided for actuarial valuations of employees’ defined benefit obligations. Furthermore, we have examined the sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions in valuing the defined benefit obligations. We also evaluated the objectivity and competence of management's expert involved in the valuation of the defined benefit obligation. We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used, and tested the accuracy of the calculation, to estimate the liability.\nThe actuarial valuations of employee benefit obligations are dependent on market conditions and assumptions made. The key audit matter specifically relates to the following key assumptions: discount rate, inflation expectations and life expectancy assumptions. The setting of these assumptions is complex and requires the exercise of significant management judgement with the support of third-party actuary.\n240",

We also:\n– Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.\n– Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n241",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n– Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\nWe describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nOther Matters\n7.\nWe did not audit the financial statements / information of 6034 branches (including 35 Foreign branches) included in the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank whose financial statements/ financial information reflects total assets of H23,18,952 Crore at March 31, 2024 and total revenue of H1,77,712 Crore for the year ended on that date, as considered in the Standalone Financial Statements. The financial statements/ information of these branches have been audited by the branch auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these branches, is based solely on the report of such branch auditors.\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter.\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n8.\nThe Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss Account have been drawn up in accordance with Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; and these give information as required to be given by virtue of the provisions of the State Bank of India Act, 1955 and regulations there under.\nSubject to the limitations of the audit indicated in paragraphs 6 to 8 above and as required by the State Bank of India Act, 1955, and subject also to the limitations of disclosure required therein and as required by sub-section (3) of section 30 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, we report that:\na)\nWe have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit and have found them to be satisfactory;\nb)\nThe transactions of the Bank, which have come to our notice, have been within the powers of the Bank; and\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the Key Audit Matters.\nc)\nd)\nThe returns received from the offices and branches of the Bank have been found adequate for the purposes of our audit.\nThe profit and loss account shows the true balance of profit for the year ended 31.3.2024.\n242",

Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the assessed risk.

This results in generation of a higher number of outstanding transactions, and hence a large value of gross notional principal of the portfolio, while the net market risk is lower.\n4\non given Guarantees behalf constituents, of acceptances, endorsements and other obligations\nAs a part of its commercial banking activities, the Group issues documentary credits and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits enhance the credit standing of the customers of the Group. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payment in the event of the customer failing to fulfil its financial or performance obligations.\n5\nOther items for which the Group is contingently liable\nThe Group enters into currency options, forward rate agreements, currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-Bank participants on its own account and for customers. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest/principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts that are recorded as Contingent Liabilities, are typically amounts used as a benchmark for the calculation of the interest component of the contracts. Further, these also include estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account and not provided for, letter of comforts issued by SBI on behalf of Associates & Subsidiaries, SBI’s Liability under Depositors Education and Awareness Fund A/c and other sundry contingent liabilities.\nThe contingent liabilities mentioned above are dependent upon the outcome of court/arbitration/out of court settlements, disposal of appeals, the amount being called up, terms of contractual obligations, devolvement and raising of demand by concerned parties, as the case may be.\n Movement of provisions against contingent liabilities:\nThe movement of provisions against contingent liabilities given in the table below:\nSr No.\nParticulars\nCurrent Year\n(H in Crore) Previous Year\na\nOpening Balance\n3,115.33\n3,669.17\nb\nAdditions during the year\n138.63\n143.99\nc\nAmount utilised during the year\n534.19\n86.65\nd\nUnused amount reversed during the year\n99.38\n611.18\ne\nClosing balance\n2,620.39\n3,115.33\n3.\nInter-Bank/ Company balances between group entities are being reconciled on an ongoing basis and there is no material effect on the profit and loss account of the current year.\n4.\nNo disclosure on divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs is required by SBI with respect to RBI’s supervisory process for the year ended 31st March 2023, based on the conditions mentioned in RBI Circular No. DOR.ACC.REC.

The Bank classifies these Advances based on IRAC norms as per its accounting policy No. 3.\nIdentification of performing and non-performing Advances involves establishment of proper mechanism. The Bank accounts for all the transactions related to Advances in its Information Technology System (IT System) viz. Core Banking Solution (CBS) which identifies whether the advances are performing or non- performing.\nFurther, NPA classification and calculation of provision (except in case of foreign offices) is done through another IT System viz. Centralised Credit Data Processing (CCDP) Application Software and other processes.\nThe carrying value of these advances (net of provisions) may be materially misstated if, either individually or in aggregate, the IRAC norms are not properly followed.\nConsidering the nature of the transactions, regulatory requirements, existing business environment, estimation/ judgement involved in valuation of securities and calculation of provisions, it is a matter of high importance for the intended users of the Standalone Financial Statements.

Pension and gratuity obligations are funded by the Bank. Shortfall, if any, in Bank’s Provident Fund Scheme is also provided for on actuarial basis. The Bank makes periodic contributions to fund administered by Trustees based on an independent external actuarial valuation carried out annually.

A significant part of the company’s financial processes is heavily reliant on IT systems with automated processes and controls over the capturing, valuing and recording of transactions. Thus, there exists a risk that gaps in the IT Control Environment could result in the financial accounting and reporting records being materially misstated.\nThe company uses several systems for its overall financial reporting. We have identified “IT systems and controls” as key audit matters because of significant use of IT system and the scale and complexity of the IT architecture.\nSample testing of key control over IT systems having impact\non financial accounting and reporting.\nAssessed the IT system processes for effectiveness of some of the key controls with respect to financial accounting and reporting records by sample testing; and\nOur audit approach relies on automated controls and therefore procedures are designed to test control over IT systems, segregation of duties, interface and system application controls over key financial accounting and reporting systems.\nReviewed the report of independent information system auditors which has confirmed the various system control measures adopted by the company. Principal Audit Procedures:\nReviewed the report of independent information system auditors which has confirmed the various system control measures adopted by the company. Principal Audit Procedures:\nThe company’s investment portfolio consists of Policyholders’ investments (traditional and unit linked policy holders) and Shareholders investment.\nTotal investment portfolio of the company (i.e. Asset under management (AUM)) represents 99.02 per cent of the Company’s total assets.\nInvestments are made and valued in accordance with Insurance Act, 1938, IRDAI (Investment) Regulations, 2016 (“Investment Regulation”), IRDAI (Preparation of Financial Statement Regulation) 2002 (“Financial Statement Regulations”), Investment Policy of the Company and relevant Indian GAAPs.\nThese valuation methods used multiple observable market inputs, including observable interest rate, index levels, credit spreads, equity prices, counter party credit quality, and corresponding market volatility levels etc.\nThe portfolio of quoted investments is 39.39 per cent of the Company’s AUM and the portfolio of investments that are valued primarily using observable inputs is 58.80 per cent of the Company’s AUM. We do not consider these investments to be at a high risk of significant misstatement, or to be subject to a significant level of judgement because they comprise liquid, quoted investments. However, due to their materiality in the context of the standalone financial statements as a whole, they are considered to be one of the areas which had the significant impact on our overall audit strategy.\nThe portfolio of unquoted investments is 1.22 per cent of the Company’s AUM. The valuation of unquoted investment involves judgement depending on the observability of the inputs into the valuation and further judgement in determining the appropriate valuation methodology where external pricing sources are either not readily available or are unreliable.\nWe assessed appropriateness of the pricing methodologies with reference to IRDAI Investment Regulations, Financial Statement Regulations, Company’s internal investment and valuation policy.\nAssessed the process and tested the operating effectiveness of the key controls, including the Company’s review and approval of the estimates and assumptions used for the valuation including key authorisation and data input controls.\nFair value is best evidenced by quoted market prices in an active market. Where quoted market prices are not available, the quoted prices of similar products or valuation models with observable market based inputs are used to estimate fair value. The calculation of estimated fair value is based on market conditions at a specific point in time and may not be reflective of future fair values.\nFor quoted investments, the valuation was done in accordance with the independent pricing sources / market prices in an active market.\nFor unquoted investments, we critically evaluated the valuation assessment and resulting conclusions in order to determine the appropriateness of the valuations recorded with reference to the assessment made by the management for such valuation.\nThe valuation of these investment was considered to be one of the areas which required significant auditor attention and was one of the matter of most significance in the financial statements due to the materiality of total value of investments to the financial statements.\n301",

The same involves judgements in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards to determine the final outcome of such open litigation matters.\nPrincipal Audit Procedures: • We read the various regulatory correspondences and related documents pertaining to litigation cases and corroborated them with our understanding of legal position as per various statues.\nThe management with the help of its experts, as needed, have made judgements relating to the likelihood of an obligation arising and whether there is a need to recognise a provision or disclose a contingent liability. We therefore focused on this area as a result of uncertainty and potential material impact.\nWe obtained legal opinion sought by management from the independent legal counsel including opinion of our own team to review the sustainability of the dispute. We discussed the status and potential exposure in respect of significant litigation with the company’s internal legal team and obtaining details regarding the progress of various litigations including management views on the likely outcome of each litigation and the magnitude of potential exposure.\nThe various litigation matters were reviewed in order to assess the facts and circumstances and to identify the potential exposures and to satisfy ourselves that it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or in certain cases where the amount cannot be estimated reliably, such obligation is disclosed by the company as a contingent liability.\nKey Audit Matters as reported by auditors of SBI Capital Markets Limited:\nviii\nEvaluation of uncertain tax positions:\nPrincipal Audit Procedures:\nThe company has material uncertain tax positions including matters under dispute which involves significant judgement to determine the possible outcome of these disputes.\nWe evaluated the Company’s processes and controls for monitoring the tax disputes.\nObtained risk assessment of tax litigation from our internal tax expert to assess management’s judgement and assumption on such matters to challenge the management’s underlying assumptions in estimating the tax provision and the possible outcome of the disputes. They also considered legal precedence and other rulings in evaluating management’s position on these uncertain tax positions.\nInformation Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report thereon\n4.\nThe Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the Corporate Governance report (but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements and our auditors’ report thereon), which we obtained at the time of issue of this auditors’ report. The Other Information also includes the Directors’ Report of the Bank including annexures in annual report thereon, which is expected to be made available to us after the date of this Auditors’ Report.\nIn connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this Auditors’ Report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this matter.\nOur opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and Pillar 3 disclosures under the Basel III and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n302",

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and applicable laws for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the respective financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nAuditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements\n6.\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material, if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.\nObtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, respective Board of Directors of the Group Entities is responsible for assessing the respective Group Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group Entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThose Board of Directors of the Group Entities are also responsible for overseeing the respective Group Entity’s financial reporting process.\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\nConclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are\n303",

The ICAAP details the capital planning process and carries out an assessment covering measurement, monitoring, internal controls, reporting, capital requirement and stress testing of the following Risks:\nCredit Risk • Operational Risk • Liquidity Risk • Compliance Risk • Pension Fund Obligation Risk • Reputation Risk • Residual Risk from Credit Risk Mitigants • Talent Risk • Any other applicable Risk\nMarket Risk • Credit Concentration Risk • Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book • Country Risk • Strategic Risk • Model Risk • Contagion Risk • Cyber Risk • Underwriting Risk\nSensitivity Analysis is conducted annually or more frequently as required, on the movement of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) in the medium horizon of 3 to 5 years, considering the projected investment in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures by SBI and growth in Advances by SBI and its Subsidiaries (Domestic / Foreign). This analysis is done for the SBI and SBI Group separately.\nCRAR of the Bank and for the Group as a whole is estimated to be well above the Regulatory CAR in the medium horizon of 3 to 5 years. However, to maintain adequate capital, the Bank has options to augment its capital resources by raising Subordinated Debt, Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS), Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS), Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS), Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs) and Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) besides Equity as and when required.\nStrategic Capital Plan for the Foreign Subsidiaries covers an assessment of capital requirement for growth of assets and the capital required complying with various local regulatory requirements and prudential norms.

For revolving facilities like cash credit, default would also mean, without prejudice to the above, the outstanding balance remaining continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit or drawing power, whichever is lower, for more than 30 days.\n Discussion of the Bank’s Credit Risk Management Policy\nThe Bank has an integrated Credit Risk Management, Credit Risk Mitigation and Collateral Management Policy in place which is reviewed annually. Over the years, the policy & procedures in this regard have been refined as a result of evolving concepts and actual experience. The policy and procedures have been aligned to the approach laid down in Basel-II and RBI guidelines.\nCredit Risk Management encompasses identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring and control of the credit risk in exposures.\nIn the processes of identification and assessment of Credit Risk, the following functions are undertaken:\n(i)\nDeveloping and refining the Credit Risk Assessment (CRA) Models/Scoring Models to assess the Counterparty Risk, by taking into account the various risks categorised broadly into Financial, Business, Industrial and Management Risks, each of which is scored separately.\n(ii)\nConducting industry research to give specific policy prescriptions and setting quantitative exposure parameters for handling portfolio in large / important industries, by issuing advisories on the general outlook for the Industries / Sectors, from time to time.\nThe measurement of Credit Risk involves computation of Credit Risk Components viz Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure At Default (EAD).\nThe monitoring and control of Credit Risk includes setting up exposure limits to achieve a well-diversified portfolio across dimensions such as single borrower, group borrower and industries. For better risk management and avoidance of concentration of Credit Risks, internal guidelines on prudential exposure norms in respect of individual companies, group companies, Banks, individual borrowers, non-corporate entities, sensitive sectors such as capital market, real estate, sensitive commodities, etc., are in place. Credit Risk Stress Tests are conducted at half yearly interval to identify vulnerable areas for initiating corrective action, where necessary.\nThe Bank has also a Loan Policy which aims at continued improvement of the overall quality of assets at the portfolio level, by establishing a commonality of approach regarding credit basics, appraisal skills, documentation standards and awareness of institutional concerns and strategies, while leaving enough room for flexibility and innovation.\nThe Bank has processes and controls in place in regard to various aspects of Credit Risk Management such as appraisal, pricing, credit approval authority, documentation, reporting and monitoring, review and renewal of credit facilities, management of problem loans, credit monitoring, etc. The Bank also has a system of Credit Audit with the aims of achieving continuous improvement in the quality of the credit portfolio with exposure of H20 Crore. and above. Credit Audit covers audit of credit sanction decisions at various levels. Both the pre-sanction process and post-sanction position are examined as a part of the Credit Audit System. Credit Audit also examines identified Risks and suggests Risk Mitigation Measures.\n318",

In view of the above, Regulated Entities/ Market Participants are advised by RBI, in respect of ratings/credit evaluations required in terms of any guidelines issued by them, no such fresh ratings/evaluations shall be obtained from the above-mentioned rating agency with immediate effect.

Part B of this policy deals with Credit Risk Mitigation and Collateral Management, addressing the Bank’s approach towards the credit risk mitigants used for capital calculation.\nThe objective of this Policy is to enable classification and valuation of credit risk mitigants in a manner that allows regulatory capital adjustment to reflect them.\nThe Policy adopts the Comprehensive Approach, which allows full offset of collateral (after appropriate haircuts), wherever applicable against exposures, by effectively reducing the exposure amount by the value ascribed to the collateral.

Internal factors include the composition of the Bank's assets and liabilities, quality, maturity, existing rates and re-pricing period of deposits, borrowings, loans and investments. External factors cover general economic conditions. Rising or falling interest rates impact the Bank depending on whether the Balance Sheet is asset sensitive or liability sensitive. The Bank identifies the inherent risks associated with the changing interest rates on its on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures in the banking book from both a short-term and long-term perspective.\n1.1 Structure and organisation\nThe Asset-Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for evolving appropriate systems and procedures for ongoing identification and analysis of Balance Sheet risks and laying down parameters for efficient management of these risks through ALM Policy of the Bank. ALCO, therefore, periodically monitors and controls the risks and returns, funding and deployment, setting Bank's lending and deposit rates, and directing the investment activities of the Bank. The Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors (RMCB) oversees the implementation of the system for ALM and reviews its functioning periodically and provides direction. It reviews various decisions taken by ALCO for managing interest rate risk.\n1.2 Scope and nature of risk reporting and measurement systems\nRBI has stipulated monitoring of Interest Rate Risk at monthly intervals through a Statement of Interest Rate Sensitivity under Traditional Gap Analysis (IRS-TGA). Accordingly, ALCO reviews IRS-TGA on monthly basis and monitors the Earnings at Risk (EaR) which measures the change in Net Interest Income of the Bank due to parallel change in interest rate on both the assets & liabilities.\nRBI has also stipulated to estimate the impact of change in interest rates on economic value of Bank’s assets and liabilities through Interest Rate Sensitivity under Duration Gap Analysis (IRS-DGA), which Bank carries out on monthly basis. The impact of interest rate changes on the Market Value of Equity is monitored through IRS-DGA by recognising the changes in the value of assets and liabilities by a given change in the market interest rate. The change in value of equity (including reserves) with 2% parallel shift in interest rates for both assets and liabilities is estimated.\nEaR: The immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on Bank's earnings through changes in its Net Interest Income (NII). EaR is useful in calculating the impact of the change in interest rate on the NII for a shorter period of time (impact over a one-year period). The EaR computations include the banking book as well as the trading book.\nMVE: A long-term impact of changes in interest rates is on Bank's Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net Worth through changes in the economic value of its liabilities and off-balance sheet positions. Although these changes in value do not pass through earnings, they have a bearing on Bank’s capital position.\nThe Bank uses MVE approach as part of a framework to manage IRRBB for its domestic and foreign operations. Impact on MVE is assessed for the overall Bank and Banking Book separately. In order to effectively monitor and manage IRRBB, the ALM Policy stipulates separate MVE limits for overall Bank and Banking Book.\n1.3 Policies for hedging and mitigating risk\nThe Bank has a policy for undertaking hedge transactions. Depending on the underlying and prevailing market conditions, the Bank enters into hedge transactions for identified assets or liabilities. Derivative instruments like Interest Rate Swaps, OIS, Forward Rate Agreements and Cross Currency Swaps are used as a hedging technique by the Bank.\n331",

To mitigate this risk, derivative transactions are undertaken only with those counterparties where approved counterparty limits are in place. Counterparty limits for banks are assessed using internal models considering a number of financial parameters like networth, capital adequacy ratio, rating etc. For corporates, the Derivatives limits are assessed and sanctioned in conjunction with regular credit limit as part of regular appraisal.\n332",

During the year, we reaffirmed our commitment to sustainable banking practices which result in positive social impact, embodying the ethos of “Synergising Sustainability: Within and Beyond”. The report aptly encapsulates the Bank’s internal operations, in sustainability robust governance, strong risk management framework and aspirations of our stakeholders. Additionally, role in contributing to a sustainable ecosystem beyond influencing the environment, society, economy and stakeholders including our customers through a diverse range of initiatives.\njourney\nit highlights\nthe Bank’s\nits operations, positively\nThe Bank has been publishing details of its ESG performance through the annual Sustainability Report as per Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines since FY17 and Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting since FY23 in compliance with the SEBI guidelines. Bank is committed to developing a culture of sustainability in every aspect of Banking through employee engagement, automation of processes, compliance with regulatory reporting framework and capacity building initiatives.\nThe Sustainability and ESG space has been evolving rapidly in recent times and there continue to be many policy and regulatory interventions which help in sensitising the market players on the criticality of ensuring that their operations are sustainable. The Securities and Exchange Board of (SEBI) has introduced the updated BRSR framework in July 2023, compliance of which is mandatory for the top 1000 listed entities (by market capitalisation) from FY24. Further top 150 listed entities have to mandatorily undertake reasonable assurance of the BRSR Core. The framework also introduces disclosures for value chains that top 250 listed entities have to make from FY25. Augmenting the ESG disclosure to include value chain signifies the growing importance of synergising Sustainability not only within the organisation but also beyond it.\nIndia\nReserve Bank of India’s Report on Currency and Finance (RCF) dated 3rd May 2023 further underscores role of financial institutions in supporting sustainable economy by incorporating ESG considerations into their decision-making processes and assessing the long-term sustainability of businesses and investments. Another significant step by the RBI in this direction is the proposed introduction of a Disclosure framework on Climate-related Financial Risks published in February 2024, requiring regulated entities (REs) to disclose\nthe pivotal\nrisk information on governance, strategy, management & metrics and targets. ESG reporting landscape thus is constantly evolving, demanding establishing and streamlining of systems and processes to address the concerns of all the stakeholders.\nIndia is accelerating its efforts to address climate change and achieve its net-zero targets by 2070 by developing a low-carbon transition strategy and promoting responsible consumption. The Government of India’s focus on solar power development projects, increased investments in renewable energy and support for climate technology is a testimony to this. Additionally, in the Union Budget 2023-24, significant investments were allocated to “green growth”, focusing on the transition to net zero by green energy adaptation, enhancing climate resilience and fostering the growth of bio economy.\nBeing India’s largest public sector bank, SBI recognises its role in driving India’s progress towards sustainable development and has fulfilling its ESG strategy towards aligned national commitments and integration of Climate risk in Sustainable finance, while ensuring regulatory compliance.\nSBI is integrating ESG criteria in its product offerings and policy development, reducing carbon footprint by digitalisation of processes and other initiatives such as purchasing green energy and is also driving green transition in India by supporting sustainable activities while promoting economic growth. Bank has an ESG Financing Framework, in alignment with the Sustainable Finance Guidelines and Principles of International Capital Market Association (ICMA), which serves as a roadmap for our bond and loan issuance programmes, ensuring that proceeds are directed supporting eligible activities and projects with environmental or social benefits. During the year, we successfully raised USD 250 million through green bonds, in accordance with our ESG Financing Framework. Bank has put in place a Policy on issuance of Green Deposits and Financing Framework in accordance with RBI guidelines.\ntowards\nBank has also constituted a top-level Climate Change Risk Management Committee to enhance governance and resilience in the face of climate-related risks and to provide strategic guidance and oversight to ensure that climate\nDuring the year, we successfully raised USD 250 million through green bonds, in accordance with our ESG Financing Framework.

Conceived as a “Horizontal Business Unit” the unit is positioned to steer the Bank efforts in climate finance, targeting a net-zero pathway (Scope 1, 2 and 3) for the Bank by its centenary year in 2055. The Unit aims to facilitate minimum of 7.5% of the Bank’s domestic loan portfolio to be ‘green’ by 2030. Leveraging expertise from various departments, the Unit ensures focused attention, improved coordination and control, capitalising on emerging business opportunities and developing a green portfolio for the Bank, thereby catalysing the green transition of the economy.\nSBI also partners with various international agencies, Multilateral Development Banks and Development Financial Institutions to make available affordable credit to the emerging sustainable commercial activities. Bank deploys the Lines of Credit (LoCs) availed from these institutions to fund projects that help create a positive environmental and social impact. Bank has also introduced “SBI Green Rupee Term Deposit” in line with the RBI guidelines, the proceeds of which will be used for supporting eligible green activities.\nBank is progressing towards Carbon neutrality target leveraging internal operations by favourable green tariff policies and through open access channel via solar/wind to enhance the procurement of renewable energy for its large establishments.

The state-wise average unit cost (INR/kWH) is calculated from the data of monthly electricity consumption (kWH) and average amount paid towards electricity bill (INR) from a sample set of branches/offices. The ratio between electricity expenses (INR) of branches across each state (VPS) and derived unit cost across each state from sampled branches gives the electricity consumption for all branches/offices. This is multiplied by a specific emission factor to arrive at emissions due to purchased electricity under Scope 2.\nThe Bank has committed to be Carbon Neutral (Scope 1 and 2) by the year 2030 in its internal operations. To achieve its carbon neutrality target, the Bank is in the process of implementing an integrated actionable strategy roadmap built around three main pillars:\n(i) Reducing the Bank’s carbon footprint on the supply side\n(ii) Promoting sustainable practices on the demand side\n(iii) Retiring carbon offsets for the residual emissions\nDemand-side Interventions Undertaken\nDiesel\n(i) Replacement of old ACs to energy-efficient ACs\nFor FY24, diesel consumption data (in litres) is captured from the sample set of branches/offices along with ownership details. Average consumption per branch is calculated from the sample diesel consumption data, which is then extrapolated to the overall population. The percentage of Bank-owned/third-party DG sets is applied to total diesel consumption data to calculate the emissions from Bank-owned/third-party DG sets under Scope 1 and 2.\n(ii) Installation of energy efficient equipment such as LEDs.\n(iii) Installation of electric vehicle chargers\nSupply-side Interventions Undertaken\nOn-site solar installations\nBusiness Travel\nSwitching to open access / green tariff\nThe data of employee travel for various modes of transport such as rented taxi, buses, trains and air travel is recorded in the Bank’s HRMS portal, alongside corresponding expenditure and distance travelled.

The emissions due to these vehicles is considered under Scope 1.\nA similar methodology is adopted for rented vehicles to arrive at emissions due to business travel under Scope 3.\nFugitive Emissions - Fire Extinguishers\nThe Bank uses CO2-based fire extinguishers across locations and data of cylinders refilled during the reporting period is collected from the sample list of branches. The average value is then applied to overall branches on the basis of population category to arrive at the overall refilled quantity. Specific Global Warming Potential (GWP) is applied for calculating emissions.\nFugitive Emissions - Refrigerants Leak from AC and HVAC\nWaste Management\nGiven its nature of business, the Bank’s significant sources of waste generation are limited to food waste such as computers, phones, etc.\nIn its efforts to manage waste effectively, SBI has undertaken the Reducing, Reusing and Recycling (3R) approach and follows responsible waste segregation and disposal practices. Among the different types of waste produced, e-waste emerges as particularly significant due to its environmental impact. The Bank has also formulated an e-waste policy to ensure safe and\nresponsible disposal, recording and reporting of electronic waste.\nThe Bank focuses on reducing paper usage and promoting environmentally responsible behaviour through extensive digitalisation of products and processes for internal operations and implementing Green Banking practices, including paperless banking.\nThe Bank also sensitises its employees and public alike on responsible waste management practices through awareness sessions and regularly conducts clean-up drives.\nThe Bank tracks data regarding the refrigerants used to replenish air conditioning encompassing both HVAC and split ACs along with details of the type of refrigerant utilised and quantity of refrigerant refilled from the sample set of branches. For ACs, the data is extrapolated to all branches considering population size across metro, rural, semi-urban and Urban areas. For HVACs, data regarding refilling is directly utilised for the calculation without extrapolation given that HVAC systems are installed only in select few locations included in the sample size.
