As per the prevailing Regulation 2(1)(zc)(i) read with the proviso to Regulation 23(1) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, transactions involving transfer of resources, services or obligations between a listed entity or any of its subsidiaries on one hand and a related party of the listed entity or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand will be considered as “related party transactions”, and as “material related party transactions”, if the transaction to be entered into individually or taken together with previous transactions during a financial year, exceeds ` 10.00 billion or 10% of the annual consolidated turnover of the listed entity as per the last audited financial statements of the listed entity, whichever is lower. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited (ICICI Life) renders insurance services as per the terms agreed with the service receiver on an arm's length basis, to meet the business requirements. The related parties of the Bank and its subsidiaries that are not related parties of ICICI Life and its subsidiary also avail insurance services from ICICI Life. The transactions of ICICI Life with such related parties of the Bank and its subsidiaries do not qualify as ‘related party transactions’ in terms of the SEBI Listing Regulations for ICICI Life but qualify as ‘related party transactions’ for the Bank. Through this proposal, an approval is being sought for such material related party transactions for FY2026. In view of the above, approval of the Members is sought for the following: Particulars Name of the party undertaking the transaction Name of the related party and relationship Type of transaction Details of transactions ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited (Subsidiary of the Bank) All related parties of the Bank and its subsidiaries that are not related parties of ICICI Life and its subsidiary • Premium received by ICICI Life on issuance/re-issuance of policies Claim benefits paid by ICICI Life on settlement/surrender of the policy Value of the transaction Pre-closure and re-issuance of the policy for the change in policy schemes Premium received on issuance/re-issuance of policies: As per the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and the scale of business of the related parties of the Bank and its subsidiaries.

Claim benefits paid on settlement/surrender/change in insurance policy schemes: As per terms and conditions of the insurance policy and the Company’s claim settlement procedures. 52 | Annual Report 2023-24",
    "summarized": "The Board recommends seeking Member approval for Ordinary Resolution at Item No. 26, which requires prior shareholder approval for material related party transactions exceeding `10.00 billion or 10% of annual consolidated turnover. Transactions with ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited (subsidiary) involve premium receipts and claim benefits on policy issuance/re-issuance, settlement/surrender, and change in insurance policy schemes."

System liquidity reduced from an average of ` 25.0 billion in the month of March 2023 to ` -434.0 billion in March 2024.

    "summarized": "Global growth is expected to slow from 3.2% in 2023 to 3.0% in 2024, primarily due to softer growth prospects in Europe and China. The US economy will continue to grow above its trend pace. Headline inflation may moderate, but services inflation could limit disinflation. Developed Market central banks are poised to ease policy, with the ECB and BoE leading the FOMC. Risks include geo-political tensions and monetary policy tightening. India's real GVA grew 6.5% in Q4-2024, while GDP grew 7.8%, driven by investment and services demand. The Rupee depreciated 1.4% in fiscal 2024, while the S&P BSE Sensex increased 24.85%.

Net interest income and spread analysis The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the net interest income and spread analysis. ` in billion, except percentages Particulars Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 % change Interest income 1,092.31 1,428.91 30.8 Interest expense 471.02 685.85 45.6 Net interest income 621.29 743.06 19.6 Average interest-earning assets 13,872.53 16,412.08 18.3 Average interest-bearing liabilities 11,998.16 14,121.39 17.7 Net interest margin 4.48% 4.53% Average yield 7.87% 8.71% Average cost of funds 3.93% 4.86% Interest spread 3.94% 3.85% 1 All amounts have been rounded off to the nearest ` 10.0 million. Net interest income increased by 19.6% from ` 621.29 billion in fiscal 2023 to ` 743.06 billion in fiscal 2024 primarily due to an increase in the net interest margin by 5 basis points and an increase of 18.3% in the average interest- earning assets. Net interest margin increased by 5 basis points from 4.48% in fiscal 2023 to 4.53% in fiscal 2024. The loan book of the Bank got repriced faster because of higher proportion of repo and other floating rate linked book, while the cost of deposits increased with a lag given the fixed rate nature of the term deposit book. As a result, the net interest margin increased from 3.96% in fiscal 2022 to 4.48% in fiscal 2023 and to 4.53% in fiscal 2024. Net interest margin was 4.01% in Q1-2023 and started increasing from Q2-2023, peaking at 4.90% in Q4-2023. The net interest margin thereafter starting declining, reflecting the peaking of asset yields and rise in deposit cost to 4.40% in Q4-2024. 126 | Annual Report 2023-24",

Net interest income increased by 19.6% from $621.29 billion in Fiscal 2023 to $743.06 billion in Fiscal 2024, driven by a 5 basis point increase in net interest margin and an 18.3% increase in average interest-earning assets."

These are classified as contingency provisions.\nEvaluated the governance process and review controls over calculations of provision of non-performing advances, basis of provisioning in accordance with the Board approved policy.\nSelected a sample of borrowers based on quantitative and qualitative risk factors for their assessment of identification & classification as NPA appropriate including computation of overdue ageing to assess its correct classification and provision amount as per extant IRAC norms and the Bank policy.\nSince the identification of NPAs and provisioning for advances require significant level of estimation and given its significance to the overall audit including possible observation by RBI which could result into in the financial statements, we have disclosure ascertained identification and provisioning for NPAs as a key audit matter.\nPerformed other substantive procedures included and not limited to the following:\n\nSelected samples of performing loans and assessed independently as to whether those should be classified as NPA;\n\nFor samples selected, reviewed the collateral valuations, financial statements and other qualitative information\n\nConsidered the accounts reported by the Bank and other Banks as Special Mention Accounts (“SMA”) in RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC)/ Centralised Information Management System (CIMS) to identify stress.\n\nFor selected samples, assessed independently, the accounts that can potentially be classified as NPA.\n\nInquired with the credit and risk departments to ascertain if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence of an event of default in a particular loan account or any product category which needed to be considered as NPA.\n\nExamined the accounts under watchlist report provided by the risk department.\nAnnual Report 2023-24 | 145",

The risk of identification of NPAs is affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors. Additionally, the Bank makes provisions on exposures that are not classified as NPA including advances to certain sectors and identified advances or group advances. These are classified as contingency provisions. Evaluated the governance process and review controls over calculations of provision of non-performing advances, basis of provisioning in accordance with the Board approved policy. Selected a sample of borrowers based on quantitative and qualitative risk factors for their assessment of identification & classification as NPA appropriate including computation of overdue ageing to assess its correct classification and provision amount as per extant IRAC norms and the Bank policy. Since the identification of NPAs and provisioning for advances require significant level of estimation and given its significance to the overall audit including possible observation by RBI which could result into in the financial statements, we have disclosure ascertained identification and provisioning for NPAs as a key audit matter. Performed other substantive procedures included and not limited to the following:  Selected samples of performing loans and assessed independently as to whether those should be classified as NPA;  For samples selected, reviewed the collateral valuations, financial statements and other qualitative information  Considered the accounts reported by the Bank and other Banks as Special Mention Accounts (“SMA”) in RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC)/ Centralised Information Management System (CIMS) to identify stress.  For selected samples, assessed independently, the accounts that can potentially be classified as NPA.  Inquired with the credit and risk departments to ascertain if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence of an event of default in a particular loan account or any product category which needed to be considered as NPA.  Examined the accounts under watchlist report provided by the risk department. Annual Report 2023-24 | 145",
    "summarized": "The auditor's key audit matter is the identification and provision for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). The Bank has implemented a policy as per IRAC guidelines, but there are risks associated with NPA identification, including stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors. The auditor tested application controls, reviewed monitoring mechanisms, and evaluated governance processes to ensure accurate provisioning. Disclosure was made regarding the identification and provisioning for NPAs due to its significance to the overall audit."

Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense is the aggregate amount of current tax and deferred tax expense incurred by the Bank. The current tax expense and deferred tax expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and as per Accounting Standard 22 - Accounting for Taxes on Income respectively. Deferred tax adjustments comprise changes in the deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year and change in tax rate.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised by considering the impact of timing differences between taxable income and accounting income for the current year, and carry forward losses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The impact of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognised in the profit and loss account.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised and re-assessed at each reporting date, based upon management’s judgement as to whether their realisation is considered as reasonably certain. However, in case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried forward loss, deferred tax assets will be recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation of such assets.\n11. Impairment of Assets\nThe Bank follows revaluation model of accounting for its premises and the recoverable amount of the revalued assets is considered to be close to its revalued amount. Accordingly, separate assessment for impairment of premises is not required.\nFor assets other than premises, the Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Impairment loss, if any, is provided in the profit and loss account to the extent the carrying amount of assets exceeds their estimated recoverable amount.\n12. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\nThe Bank estimates the probability of any loss that might be incurred on outcome of contingencies on the basis of information available up to the date on which the financial statements are prepared. A provision is recognised when an enterprise has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are determined based on management estimates of amounts required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current management estimates. In cases where the available information indicates that the loss on the contingency is reasonably possible but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, a disclosure to this effect is made in the financial statements. In case of remote possibility neither provision nor disclosure is made in the financial statements. The Bank does not account for or disclose contingent assets, if any.\nThe Bank estimates the probability of redemption of customer loyalty reward points using an actuarial method by employing an independent actuary and accordingly makes provision for these reward points.

    "clean_content": "Interest payable on provident fund should not be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. Actuarial valuation for the interest obligation on the provident fund balances is determined by an actuary appointed by the Bank. The actuarial gains or losses arising during the year are recognised in the profit and loss account. The overseas branches of the Bank and its eligible employees contribute a certain percentage of their salary towards respective government schemes as per local regulatory guidelines. The contribution made by the overseas branches is recognised in profit and loss account at the time of contribution. Compensated absences The Bank provides for compensated absence based on actuarial valuation conducted by an independent actuary. 10. Income Taxes Income tax expense is the aggregate amount of current tax and deferred tax expense incurred by the Bank. The current tax expense and deferred tax expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and as per Accounting Standard 22 - Accounting for Taxes on Income respectively. Deferred tax adjustments comprise changes in the deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year and change in tax rate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised by considering the impact of timing differences between taxable income and accounting income for the current year, and carry forward losses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The impact of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognised in the profit and loss account. Deferred tax assets are recognised and re-assessed at each reporting date, based upon management’s judgement as to whether their realisation is considered as reasonably certain. However, in case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried forward loss, deferred tax assets will be recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation of such assets. 11. Impairment of Assets The Bank follows revaluation model of accounting for its premises and the recoverable amount of the revalued assets is considered to be close to its revalued amount. Accordingly, separate assessment for impairment of premises is not required. For assets other than premises, the Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Impairment loss, if any, is provided in the profit and loss account to the extent the carrying amount of assets exceeds their estimated recoverable amount. 12. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets The Bank estimates the probability of any loss that might be incurred on outcome of contingencies on the basis of information available up to the date on which the financial statements are prepared. A provision is recognised when an enterprise has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are determined based on management estimates of amounts required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current management estimates. In cases where the available information indicates that the loss on the contingency is reasonably possible but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, a disclosure to this effect is made in the financial statements. In case of remote possibility neither provision nor disclosure is made in the financial statements. The Bank does not account for or disclose contingent assets, if any. The Bank estimates the probability of redemption of customer loyalty reward points using an actuarial method by employing an independent actuary and accordingly makes provision for these reward points. Actuarial valuation is determined based on certain assumptions regarding mortality rate, discount rate, cancellation rate and redemption rate. 176 | Annual Report 2023-24",
    "summarized": "The Bank recognizes interest payable on provident fund at statutory rate of interest (10%), with actuarial gains/losses recognized in profit and loss account. Overseas branches contribute to government schemes, with contributions recognized in profit and loss account. Compensated absences are provided based on actuarial valuation. Income tax expense is determined under Income Tax Act 1961 and Accounting Standard 22, with deferred tax adjustments recognizing changes in tax rate and assets/liabilities. Impairment of assets follows revaluation model, with impairment losses recognized in profit and loss account. Provisions for contingencies are made based on management estimates, with disclosures for reasonably possible but un estimable losses."

Information about business and geographical segments Business Segments Pursuant to the guidelines issued by RBI on AS 17 - Segment Reporting, the following business segments have been reported. Retail Banking includes exposures which satisfy the four criteria of orientation, product, granularity and low value of individual exposures for retail exposures laid down in Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) document ‘International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework’. This segment also includes income from credit cards, debit cards, third party product distribution and the associated costs. Wholesale Banking includes all advances to trusts, partnership firms, companies and statutory bodies, which are not included under Retail Banking. Treasury includes the entire investment and derivative portfolio of the Bank. Other Banking includes leasing operations and other items not attributable to any particular business segment. Unallocated includes items such as tax paid in advance net of provision, deferred tax and provisions to the extent reckoned at the entity level. Income, expenses, assets and liabilities are either specifically identified with individual segments or are allocated to segments on a systematic basis. All liabilities are transfer priced to a central treasury unit, which pools all funds and lends to the business units at appropriate rates based on the relevant maturity of assets being funded after adjusting for regulatory reserve requirements. The transfer pricing mechanism of the Bank is periodically reviewed. The segment results are determined based on the transfer pricing mechanism prevailing for the respective reporting periods. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the business segment results on this basis. ` in million Sr. No. Particulars 1. Revenue Less: Inter-segment revenue 2.

In addition to the Bank’s Compensation Policy guidelines, the overseas branches also adhere to relevant local regulations.\nType of employees covered and number of such employees\nAll employees of the Bank are governed by the Compensation Policy.

This approach has been incorporated in the Compensation Policy, the key elements of which are given below.\no\nEffective governance of compensation: The BGRNC has oversight over compensation. The Committee defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for WTDs and equivalent positions and the organisational performance norms for variable pay based on the financial and strategic plan approved by the Board. The KPIs include both quantitative and qualitative aspects defined with sub parameters. The BGRNC assesses organisational performance and based on its assessment, it makes recommendations on variable pay for employees.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n11. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism\nthroughout the audit. We also:\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. 11. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls; Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management; Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates to cease to continue as a going concern; Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group and its associates to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Annual Report 2023-24 | 259",
    "summarized": "The auditor's objectives for the audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about the consolidated financial statements' material accuracy, free from fraud or error. The auditor exercises professional judgment and maintains skepticism throughout the audit, identifying risks of material misstatement, designing procedures, and obtaining sufficient evidence. The auditor evaluates internal controls, accounting policies, estimates, and disclosures, and concludes on the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting. The auditor's conclusions are based on audit evidence up to the report date, but future events may impact the Group's ability to continue as a going concern."

    "content": "SCHEDULE 17\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOverview\nICICI Bank Limited, together with its subsidiaries and associates (collectively, the Group), is a diversified financial services group providing a wide range of banking and financial services including commercial banking, retail banking, project and corporate finance, working capital finance, insurance, venture capital and private equity, investment banking, broking and treasury products and services.\nICICI Bank Limited (the Bank), incorporated in Vadodara, India is a publicly held banking company governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financials of ICICI Bank, its subsidiaries and associates.\nEntities, in which the Bank holds, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries and other consolidating entities, more than 50.00% of the voting rights or where it exercises control, over the composition of board of directors/governing body, are fully consolidated on a line-by-line basis in accordance with the provisions of AS 21 on ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’. Investments in entities where the Bank has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the pro-rata share of their profit/(loss) is included in the consolidated profit and loss account. Assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of jointly controlled entities are consolidated using the proportionate consolidation method. Under this method, the Bank’s share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the jointly controlled entity is reported in separate line items in the consolidated financial statements. The Bank does not consolidate entities where the significant influence/control is intended to be temporary or entities which operate under severe long-term restrictions that impair their ability to transfer funds to parent/investing entity or where the objective of control is not to obtain economic benefit from their activities. All significant inter-company balances and transactions with subsidiaries and entities consolidated as per AS-21 have been eliminated on consolidation.\nBasis of preparation\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Group used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (Indian GAAP), the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) from time to time and the Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and Companies (Accounting Standard) Rule 2021, as applicable to relevant companies and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in India. In the case of the foreign subsidiaries, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as applicable to the respective foreign subsidiaries are followed. The Group follows the accrual method of accounting except where otherwise stated, and the historical cost convention. In case the accounting policies followed by a subsidiary are different from those followed by the Bank, the same have been disclosed in the respective accounting policy.

ICICI Bank Limited (the Bank), incorporated in Vadodara, India is a publicly held banking company governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financials of ICICI Bank, its subsidiaries and associates. Entities, in which the Bank holds, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries and other consolidating entities, more than 50.00% of the voting rights or where it exercises control, over the composition of board of directors/governing body, are fully consolidated on a line-by-line basis in accordance with the provisions of AS 21 on ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’. Investments in entities where the Bank has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the pro-rata share of their profit/(loss) is included in the consolidated profit and loss account. Assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of jointly controlled entities are consolidated using the proportionate consolidation method. Under this method, the Bank’s share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the jointly controlled entity is reported in separate line items in the consolidated financial statements. The Bank does not consolidate entities where the significant influence/control is intended to be temporary or entities which operate under severe long-term restrictions that impair their ability to transfer funds to parent/investing entity or where the objective of control is not to obtain economic benefit from their activities. All significant inter-company balances and transactions with subsidiaries and entities consolidated as per AS-21 have been eliminated on consolidation. Basis of preparation The accounting and reporting policies of the Group used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (Indian GAAP), the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) from time to time and the Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and Companies (Accounting Standard) Rule 2021, as applicable to relevant companies and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in India. In the case of the foreign subsidiaries, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as applicable to the respective foreign subsidiaries are followed. The Group follows the accrual method of accounting except where otherwise stated, and the historical cost convention. In case the accounting policies followed by a subsidiary are different from those followed by the Bank, the same have been disclosed in the respective accounting policy. Further, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited ceased to be an associate and became a subsidiary of the Bank w.e.f. February 29, 2024. Accordingly, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited has been accounted for the equity method prescribed by AS-23 on ‘Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements’ till February 29, 2024 and has been consolidated on a line-by-line basis as prescribed by AS-21 on ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ from March 1, 2024 till the reporting date. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that are considered in the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported income and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Under Intrinsic value method, options cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair market price of the underlying stock over the exercise price on the grant date. Pursuant to RBI clarification dated August 30, 2021, the cost of stock options/units granted after March 31, 2021 is recognised based on fair value method. The cost of stock options/units granted up to March 31, 2021 continues to be recognised on intrinsic value method. The Bank uses Black-Scholes model to fair value the options/units on the grant date and the inputs used in the valuation model include assumptions such as the expected life of the share option/ units, volatility, risk free rate and dividend yield. The cost of stock options/units is recognised in the profit and loss account over the vesting period. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited and ICICI Securities Limited have also formulated similar stock options/units schemes for their employees for grant of equity shares of their respective companies. The intrinsic value method is followed by them to account for their stock-based employee compensation plans. Compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair market price of the underlying stock over the exercise price on the grant date and amortised over the vesting period. The fair market price is the closing price on the stock exchange with the highest trading volume of the underlying shares of the Bank, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited and ICICI Securities Limited, immediately prior to the grant date. The banking subsidiaries namely, ICICI Bank UK PLC and ICICI Bank Canada, account for the cost of the options/units granted to employees by ICICI Bank using the fair value method as followed by the Bank. Annual Report 2023-24 | 287",
    "summarized": "Reinsurance premium is recognized with insurance premiums allocated for the year, with revisions and cancellations accounted for separately. In general insurance, premium deficiency is calculated at a segmental revenue account level. The ICICI group has stock-based compensation schemes for employees, recognizing costs using intrinsic value method until March 31, 2021, then switching to fair value method as of August 30, 2021."

The ECL for financial assets, that are not credit-impaired but have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination, is computed using a life time PD, and represents lifetime cash shortfalls that will result if a default occurs during the expected life of financial assets. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred.

The Bank also makes additional contingency provision on certain standard assets. The contingency provision is included in ‘Schedule 5 - Other Liabilities and Provisions’. The Bank has a Board approved policy for making floating provision, which is in addition to the specific and general provisions made by the Bank. The floating provision is utilised, with the approval of Board and RBI, in case of contingencies which do not arise in the normal course of business and are exceptional and non- recurring in nature and for making specific provision for impaired loans as per the requirement of extant RBI guidelines or any regulatory guidance/instructions.
